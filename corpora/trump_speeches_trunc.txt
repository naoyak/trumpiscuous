...thank you so much.  that's so nice.  isn't he a great guy.  he doesn't get a fair press; he doesn't get it.  it's just not fair.  and i have to tell you i'm here, and very strongly here, because i have great respect for steve king and have great respect likewise for citizens united, david and everybody, and tremendous resect for the tea party.  also, also the people of iowa.  they have something in common.  hard-working people.  they want to work, they want to make the country great.  i love the people of iowa.  so that's the way it is.  very simple.
with that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job.  the world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems we've caused.  our president is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and i think i was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible.  in any event, washington is broken, and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray.  very simple.  politicians are all talk, no action.  they are all talk and no action.  and it's constant; it never ends.
and i'm a conservative, actually very conservative, and i'm a republican.  and i'm very disappointed by our republican politicians.  because they let the president get away with absolute murder.  you see always, oh we're going to do this, we're going to--.  nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens.
you look at obamacare.  a total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in '16 and it is going to be a disaster.  people are closing up shops.  doctors are quitting the business.  i have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy.  he said, i have more accountants than i have patients.  and he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before and he's going to close up his business.  and he was very successful guy.  but it's happening more and more.
look at obamacare with a $5 billion website.  i have many websites, many, many websites.  they're all over the place.  but for $10, okay?
now everything about obamacare was a lie.  it was a filthy lie.  and when you think about it, lies, i mean are they prosecuted?  does anyone do anything?  and what are the republican politicians doing about it?  he lied about the doctor, he lied about every aspect.  you can keep your plan.  and you've all heard that hundreds of times.  that's like the real estate location, location.  i don't even say it anymore because everybody goes location, location.  but you have heard this about obamacare.
and it's disgraceful.  it's a big, fat, horrible lie.  your deductibles are going through the roof.  you're not going to get--unless you're hit by an army tank, you're not going to get coverage.  and people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don't have those plans anymore.  so it's a real, real disaster.  and somebody has to repeal and replace obamacare.  and they have to do it fast and not just talk about it.
now, we have to build a fence.  and it's got to be a beauty.  who can build better than trump?  i build; it's what i do.  i build; i build nice fences, but i build great buildings.  fences are easy, believe me.  i saw the other day on television people just walking across the border.  they're walking.  the military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front, coming into our country.  it is so terrible.  it is so unfair.  it is so incompetent.  and we don't have the best coming in.  we have people that are criminals, we have people that are crooks.  you can certainly have terrorists.  you can certainly have islamic terrorists.  you can have anything coming across the border.  we don't do anything about it.  so i would say that if i run and if i win, i would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border.

again, the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it.  benghazi.  oh, benghazi, benghazi.  everything is benghazi.  what happens?  nothing.
irs, e-mails.  i get sued all the time, okay.  i run a big business.  you know i've always said it's very, very hard for a person who is very successful.  i have done so many deals.  almost all of them have been tremendously successful.  you'll see that when i file my statements.  i mean you will see; you will be very proud of me, okay.  but i've always said, and i said it strongly, it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone president.  because you've done so much; you've beaten so many people; you've created so many--  look, obama, what did he do?  no deal.  he never did a deal.  he did one deal.  a house.  and if you did that house you'd be in jail right now, okay.  he got away with murder.  but i can tell you, e-mails.  irs, the e-mails, thousands of them, they were lost; they were lost.  if you were in my world you would know that e-mails can't be lost; they can't be lost.  so why aren't our politicians finding out where those e-mails are?
they talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that's the end of it.  believe me if i did something you would have a border that would be great.  but they talk about it.  and then you have a president that does an executive order.  nobody even heard of an executive order.  he does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders.  why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment--which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time; he said, i'm going to approve this and that--why didn't our republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier.  instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, i know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it.  we'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed.  so we have to do something.
jobs.  china.  i mean i've made so much money fighting against the chinese.  one of the best deals i ever did was against the chinese, and they respect me for it.  and i know them.  and they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with.  we can't believe how stupid your leaders are.  they tell me that.  now they don't know i'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not.  but they tell me that.
and by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much--goods, i mean the goods you sell are incredible; i don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries.  the euro, china is going crazy with the devaluation.  i never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing.  they are devaluing down to nothing.  and what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete.  and they're getting away with it.  and they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it.  but you watch this devaluation of all of it.  i mean the euro, china, mexico; everybody is devaluing.  and when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good.  you know it's one of those things, sounds good.  be very careful.  be very careful.  because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing.  they have it set.  don't forget another thing.  china became the number one economic power a year ago.  that was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen.  it was absolutely unthinkable.  so it happened and it's very, very sad.
now we spent $2 trillion in iraq.  we got nothing.  they don't even respect us; they don't even care about us.  until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us.  we want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, isis.  by the way, you know how they formed.  they took the oil.  and for those of you that know and love donald trump--there are some of you--have i been saying for four years, keep the oil.  so now isis has the oil.  and the stuff that isis doesn't have, iran is going to take.  so we get nothing.  we have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have.  i mean i walk down the streets of new york and i see so many wounded warriors, incredible people.  and we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military.  but, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast.  we have incompetent people.  they put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing.  it needs money.
we have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save social security.  'cause i'm not a cutter; i'll probably be the only republican that does not want to cut social security.  i'm not a cutter of social security; i want to make the country rich so that social security can be afforded, and medicare and medicaid.  get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your social security; you've been paying your security.  and like, i like congressman ryan, i like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting social security, and by the way the democrats are eating your lunch on this issue.  it's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things.
now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons.  we really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast.  we can't let iran get a nuclear weapon.  we can't do it.  can't do it.  we cannot let that happen.  you know in the old days, i would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other.
here we are in syria.  we're fighting people that want to overturn syria.  think of this.  we're fighting isis, but isis wants to overturn the government.  maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay.  but think of it; think of it.  isis is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want syria to fall.  there are so many things; there are so many things.
but the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about  too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear.  nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles.  you can take out the east coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable.  the power.  and we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens.  we've never had this before.
we have a situation in afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there.  we're trying to do the right thing.  we have leadership, again--no leadership respects us.  you know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find.  the same thing is happening there.  and i never knew that afghanistan until a year ago or so, afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals.  and we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain china is taking out all the minerals.  they're taking it out.  trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals.  so we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker.  it's really, really crazy.

so we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country.  if we don't--  the other day in ohio a bridge collapsed.  bridges are collapsing all over the country.  the reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure.
i go to saudi arabia, i go to dubai; i am doing big jobs in dubai.  i go to various different places.  i go to china.  they are building a bridge on every corner.  they have bridges that make the george washington bridge like small time stuff.  they're building the most incredible things you have ever seen.  they are building airports in qatar--which they like to say "cutter" but i've always said "qatar" so i'll keep it "qatar" what the hell.  but they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen.  and then i come back to laguardia where the runways have potholes.  the place is falling apart.  you go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart.  and they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt.  so you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place.  this is inside, not outside.  and i just left dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen.  in fact my pilot said oh mr. trump this is such an honor.  i said it's not an honor; they're just smart.  but you look at lax, and you look at kennedy airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling.
you look at all of the things that are bad--  i'll give you an example. and this isn't part of what i was going to say, but i ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails.  you know the guard rails.  the ones that sort of go like this [demonstrates with hand] that are always  bent, rusted and horrible.  did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes.  now they've been selling this thing for 25 years.  why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works.  because they don't know; they don't know what's happening.  somebody made a lot of money on that.  they don't know what is happening.
so we have to make our country great again.  we have to rebuild our country.  and we have a long way to go.  we are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money.  now we owe it to the chinese, a lot of it.  we owe it to other countries.  they're the ones that hold the debt.  and then we give them money.  we have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies.  i just ordered thousands of television sets and between lg and samsung and i mean you know--  no american company comes to see and comes to bid.  it's south korea, and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes, we're going to protect them.  what are we doing; why aren't they paying us?  why aren't they paying us; what are we doing?  i order thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason it's south korea.  you know whether it's china, south korea, but in this case televisions, south korea.  why aren't they doing something to justify what is going on?
now, we have a very important election coming up.  we have a presidential election coming up. and we have some good people.  nobody like trump of course, but these are minor details.  we have some good people.
it' can't be mitt because mitt ran and failed.  he failed.  i mean i liked him.  look--like him, dislike him--the 47% statement that he made, that's not going away.  the romneycare from massachusetts, that's not going away.  what do you think they're going to say oh we won't bring that up this time.  it's not fair because it was a long t--  that doesn't work.  but more importantly, he choked.  something happened to him in the last month.  he had that election won.  and let me tell you something.  that election, sort of like a dealmaker that can't close the deal.  i know many of those guys; they get it up to the one-yard line, they go ah, ah i can't close it.  or a golfer that can't sink the three-footer to win the tournament.  and there are many of them.  most people are like that; i mean most people are like that.  you can't give somebody another chance, 'cause actually i think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president.  i really do.  i think beating obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up, which is sad to say but true.  so you can't have romney.  he choked.
you can't have bush.  the last thing we need is another bush.  now i made that statement very strongly, and now every one says the last thing--  you know they copied it.  i'll be accused of copying the statement; that's the bad thing.  but i said it.  i was the one that said it first, and i mean it.  the last thing we need is another bush.  now, he's totally in favor of common core; that's a disaster, that's bad, it should be local and all of that.  but he's totally in favor of common core.  he's very, very weak on immigration.  don't forget--remember his statement--they come for love.  i say, what?  come for love?  you've got these people coming, half of them are criminals.  they're coming for love?  they're coming for a lot of other reasons, and it's not love.  and when he runs, you got to remember his brother really gave us obama.  i was never a big fan, but his brother gave us obama.  'cause abraham lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months.  and then he appointed justice roberts.  and jeb wanted justice roberts.  and justice roberts basically approved obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes.  so you can't have jeb bush.  and he's going to lose aside from that; he's not going to win.  so mitt and--you just can't have those two.  that's it.  that's it.  it's so simple.
so just in summing up and i just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important.  and i watch these teleprompters, and by the way i think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters.  and people say, oh he is so quick on his feet.  he is reading it.  i mean give me a break.  everything is read.  you don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk.  and that's what we ended up getting--the king of teleprompters.  but, so when i look at these things here i say you know what, it's so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing.  no problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that.  but we have to do something about these teleprompters.
but in looking at these situations--  i built an incredible company.  and you'll see that.  an incredible company; a wonderful company.  i employ thousands of people and i love doing what i'm doing.  and in a certain way, i wish i weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix.  we have such great potential.
so if i run for president and if i win, i would totally succeed in:
creating jobs;
defeating isis and stopping the islamic terrorists--and you have to do that;
reducing the budget deficit--so important, have to do it;
securing our southern border--and i mean seriously securing it;
stopping nuclear weapons in iran and elsewhere;
saving social security, medicare and medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it's not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it;
repealing obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country.  and believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody.  and everybody can be covered.  i'm not saying leave 50-percent of the people out.  everybody can be c-- this plan is just a basic disaster.  nobody knows.  as bad as the website was, this is how bad the plan itself is;
fixing our country's infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports.  and that, i can tell you, nobody is close to trump.  i just got the best hotel in north america.  i'm building, which is sort of interesting, think of this one.  i'm building one of the great hotels of the world on pennsylvania avenue, right opposite the white house, between the white house and congress.  right on penn.--  the  old post office site, and i got it from obama.  do you believe that?  and everybody wanted it.  so, i can't believe it myself.  but it's going to be fantastic;
and so many other things.
i know what needs to be done to make america great again.  we can make this country great again.  the potential is enormous.  and i am serious thinking of running for president because i can do the job.
thank you all very much.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you.  thank you very much, everybody.  thank you.  beautiful.  thank you.

thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the center for national interest for honoring me with this invitation. it truly is a great honor. i’d like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country, one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.

it’s time to shake the rust off america’s foreign policy. it’s time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold, something we have to do. the direction i will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. my foreign policy will always put the interests of the american people and american security above all else. it has to be first. has to be.

that will be the foundation of every single decision that i will make.

america first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration. but to chart our path forward, we must first briefly take a look back. we have a lot to be proud of.

in the 1940s we saved the world. the greatest generation beat back the nazis and japanese imperialists. then we saved the world again. this time, from totalitarianism and communism. the cold war lasted for decades but, guess what, we won and we won big. democrats and republicans working together got mr. gorbachev to heed the words of president reagan, our great president, when he said, tear down this wall.



history will not forget what he did. a very special man and president. unfortunately, after the cold war our foreign policy veered badly off course. we failed to develop a new vision for a new time. in fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense. logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, which led to one foreign policy disaster after another.

they just kept coming and coming. we went from mistakes in iraq to egypt to libya, to president obama’s line in the sand in syria. each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos and gave isis the space it needs to grow and prosper. very bad. it all began with a dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.

we tore up what institutions they had and then were surprised at what we unleashed. civil war, religious fanaticism, thousands of americans and just killed be lives, lives, lives wasted. horribly wasted. many trillions of dollars were lost as a result. the vacuum was created that isis would fill. iran, too, would rush in and fill that void much to their really unjust enrichment.

they have benefited so much, so sadly, for us. our foreign policy is a complete and total disaster. no vision. no purpose. no direction. no strategy. today i want to identify five main weaknesses in our foreign policy.

first, our resources are totally over extended. president obama has weakened our military by weakening our economy. he’s crippled us with wasteful spending, massive debt, low growth, a huge trade deficit and open borders. our manufacturing trade deficit with the world is now approaching $1 trillion a year.

we’re rebuilding other countries while weakening our own. ending the theft of american jobs will give us resources we need to rebuild our military, which has to happen and regain our financial independence and strength. i am the only person running for the presidency who understands this and this is a serious problem.
i’m the only one — believe me, i know them all, i’m the only one who knows how to fix it.



secondly, our allies are not paying their fair share, and i’ve been talking about this recently a lot. our allies must contribute toward their financial, political, and human costs, have to do it, of our tremendous security burden. but many of them are simply not doing so.

they look at the united states as weak and forgiving and feel no obligation to honor their agreements with us. in nato, for instance, only 4 of 28 other member countries besides america, are spending the minimum required 2 percent of gdp on defense. we have spent trillions of dollars over time on planes, missiles, ships, equipment, building up our military to provide a strong defense for europe and asia.

the countries we are defending must pay for the cost of this defense, and if not, the u.s. must be prepared to let these countries defend themselves. we have no choice.



the whole world will be safer if our allies do their part to support our common defense and security. a trump administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.

thirdly, our friends are beginning to think they can’t depend on us. we’ve had a president who dislikes our friends and bows to our enemies, something that we’ve never seen before in the history of our country. he negotiated a disastrous deal with iran, and then we watched them ignore its terms even before the ink was dry. iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon, cannot be allowed. remember that, cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.


and under a trump administration, will never, ever be allowed to have that nuclear weapon.


all of this without even mentioning the humiliation of the united states with iran’s treatment of our ten captured sailors — so vividly i remember that day. in negotiation, you must be willing to walk. the iran deal, like so many of our worst agreements, is the result of not being willing to leave the table.

when the other side knows you’re not going to walk, it becomes absolutely impossible to win — you just can’t win. at the same time, your friends need to know that you will stick by the agreements that you have with them. you’ve made that agreement, you have to stand by it and the world will be a better place. president obama gutted our missile defense program and then abandoned our missile defense plans with poland and the czech republic. he supported the ouster of a friendly regime in egypt that had a longstanding peace treaty with israel, and then helped bring the muslim brotherhood to power in its place.

israel, our great friend and the one true democracy in the middle east has been snubbed and criticized by an administration that lacks moral clarity. just a few days ago, vice president biden again criticized israel, a force for justice and peace, for acting as an impatient peace area in the region.

president obama has not been a friend to israel. he has treated iran with tender love and care and made it a great power. iran has, indeed, become a great, great power in just a very short period of time, because of what we’ve done. all of the expense and all at the expense of israel, our allies in the region and very importantly, the united states itself.

we’ve picked fights with our oldest friends, and now they’re starting to look elsewhere for help. remember that. not good.
fourth, our rivals no longer respect us. in fact, they’re just as confused as our allies, but in an even bigger problem is they don’t take us seriously anymore. the truth is they don’t respect us. when president obama landed in cuba on air force one, no leader was there, nobody, to greet him.

perhaps an incident without precedent in the long and prestigious history of air force one. then amazingly, the same thing happened in saudi arabia. it’s called no respect. absolutely no respect.

do you remember when the president made a long and expensive trip to copenhagen, denmark, to get the olympics for our country, and after this unprecedented effort, it was announced that the united states came in fourth — fourth place? the president of the united states making this trip — unprecedented — comes in fourth place. he should have known the result before making such an embarrassing commitment. we were laughed at all over the world, as we have been many, many times.

the list of humiliations go on and on and on. president obama watches helplessly as north korea increases its aggression and expands further and further with its nuclear reach. our president has allowed china to continue its economic assault on american jobs and wealth, refusing to enforce trade deals and apply leverage on china necessary to rein in north korea. we have the leverage. we have the power over china, economic power, and people don’t understand it. and with that economic power, we can rein in and we can get them to do what they have to do with north korea, which is totally out of control.

he has even allowed china to steal government secrets with cyber attacks and engaged in industrial espionage against the united states and its companies. we’ve let our rivals and challengers think they can get away with anything, and they do. they do at will. it always happens. if president obama’s goal had been to weaken america, he could not have done a better job.

finally, america no longer has a clear understanding of our foreign policy goals. since the end of the cold war and the breakup of the soviet union, we’ve lacked a coherent foreign policy. one day, we’re bombing libya and getting rid of a dictator to foster democracy for civilians. the next day, we’re watching the same civilians suffer while that country falls and absolutely falls apart. lives lost, massive moneys lost. the world is a different place.

we’re a humanitarian nation, but the legacy of the obama-clinton interventions will be weakness, confusion and disarray, a mess. we’ve made the middle east more unstable and chaotic than ever before. we left christians subject to intense persecution and even genocide.



we have done nothing to help the christians, nothing, and we should always be ashamed for that, for that lack of action. our actions in iraq, libya and syria have helped unleash isis, and we’re in a war against radical islam, but president obama won’t even name the enemy, and unless you name the enemy, you will never ever solve the problem.



hillary clinton also refuses to say the words radical islam, even as she pushes for a massive increase in refugees coming into our country. after secretary clinton’s failed intervention in libya, islamic terrorists in benghazi took down our consulate and killed our ambassador and three brave americans. then, instead of taking charge that night, hillary clinton decided to go home and sleep. incredible.

clinton blames it all on a video, an excuse that was a total lie, proven to be absolutely a total lie. our ambassador was murdered and our secretary of state misled the nation. and, by the way, she was not awake to take that call at 3 o’clock in the morning. and now isis is making millions and millions of dollars a week selling libya oil. and you know what? we don’t blockade, we don’t bomb, we don’t do anything about it. it’s almost as if our country doesn’t even know what’s happening, which could be a fact and could be true. this will all change when i become president.

to our friends and allies, i say america is going to be strong again. america is going to be reliable again. it’s going to be a great and reliable ally again. it’s going to be a friend again. we’re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy based upon american interests and the shared interests of our allies.



we’re getting out of the nation-building business and instead focusing on creating stability in the world. our moments of greatest strength came when politics ended at the water’s edge. we need a new rational american foreign policy, informed by the best minds and supported by both parties, and it will be by both parties — democrats, republicans, independents, everybody, as well as by our close allies.


this is how we won the cold war and it’s how we will win our new future struggles, which may be many, which may be complex, but we will win if i become president.



first, we need a long-term plan to halt the spread and reach of radical islam. containing the spread of radical islam must be a major foreign policy goal of the united states and indeed the world. events may require the use of military force, but it’s also a philosophical struggle, like our long struggle in the cold war.

in this, we’re going to be working very closely with our allies in the muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical islamic violence, attacks and everything else. it is a dangerous world, more dangerous now than it has ever been.

we should work — thank you.



we should work together with any nation in the region that is threatened by the rise of radical islam. but this has to be a two-way street. they must also be good to us. remember that. they have to be good to us, no longer one way. it’s now two-way. and remember, us and all we’re doing, they have to appreciate what we’ve done to them. we’re going to help, but they have to appreciate what we’ve done for them. the struggle against radical islam also takes place in our homeland. there are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. for every case known to the public, there are dozens and dozens more. we must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies. we have no idea where these people are coming from. there’s no documentation. there’s no paperwork. there’s nothing. we have to be smart. we have to be vigilant.

a pause for reassessment will help us to prevent the next san bernardino or frankly, much worse. all you have to do is look at the world trade center and september 11th, one of the great catastrophes, in my opinion, the single greatest military catastrophe in the history of our country; worse than pearl harbor because you take a look at what’s happened, and citizens were attacked, as opposed to the military being attacked — one of the true great catastrophes.

and then there’s isis. i have a simple message for them. their days are numbered. i won’t tell them where and i won’t tell them how. we must...



... we must as a nation be more unpredictable. we are totally predictable. we tell everything. we’re sending troops. we tell them. we’re sending something else. we have a news conference. we have to be unpredictable. and we have to be unpredictable starting now.

but they’re going to be gone. isis will be gone if i’m elected president. and they’ll be gone quickly. they will be gone very, very quickly.



secondly, we have to rebuild our military and our economy. the russians and chinese have rapidly expanded their military capability, but look at what’s happened to us. our nuclear weapons arsenal, our ultimate deterrent, has been allowed to atrophy and is desperately in need of modernization and renewal. and it has to happen immediately. our active duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. the navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. the air force is about one-third smaller than 1991. pilots flying b-52s in combat missions today. these planes are older than virtually everybody in this room.

and what are we doing about this? president obama has proposed a 2017 defense budget that in real dollars, cuts nearly 25 percent from what we were spending in 2011. our military is depleted and we’re asking our generals and military leaders to worry about global warming.

we will spend what we need to rebuild our military. it is the cheapest, single investment we can make. we will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. our military dominance must be unquestioned, and i mean unquestioned, by anybody and everybody.

but we will look for savings and spend our money wisely. in this time of mounting debt, right now we have so much debt that nobody even knows how to address the problem. but i do. no one dollar can be wasted. not one single dollar can we waste. we’re also going to have to change our trade, immigration and economic policies to make our economy strong again. and to put americans first again.


this will ensure that our own workers, right here in america, get the jobs and higher pay that will grow our tax revenues, increase our economic might as a nation, make us strong financially again. so, so important. we need to think smart about areas where our technological superiority, and nobody comes close, gives us an edge.

this includes 3d printing, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. a great country also takes care of its warriors. our commitment to them is absolute, and i mean absolute. a trump administration will give our servicemen and women the best equipment and support in the world when they serve and where they serve. and the best care in the world when they return as veterans and they come back home to civilian life. our veterans...



our veterans have not been treated fairly or justly. these are our great people and we must treat them fairly. we must even treat them really, really well and that will happen under the trump administration.



finally, we must develop a foreign policy based on american interests. businesses do not succeed when they lose sight of their core interests and neither do countries. look at what happened in the 1990s. our embassies in kenya and tanzania — and this was a horrible time for us — were attacked. and 17 brave sailors were killed on the u.s.s. cole.

and what did we do? it seemed we put more effort into adding china into the world trade organization, which has been a total disaster for the united states. frankly, we spent more time on that than we did in stopping al qaeda. we even had an opportunity to take out osama bin laden and we didn’t do it

and then we got hit at the world trade center and the pentagon. again, the worst attack on our country in its history. our foreign policy goals must be based on america’s core national security interests. and the following will be my priorities.

in the middle east our goals must be, and i mean must be, to defeat terrorists and promote regional stability, not radical change. we need to be clearsighted about the groups that will never be anything other than enemies. and believe me, we have groups that no matter what you do, they will be the enemy.: we have to be smart enough to recognize who those groups are, who those people are, and not help them. and we must only be generous to those that prove they are indeed our friends.



we desire to live peacefully and in friendship with russia and china. we have serious differences with these two nations, and must regard them with open eyes, but we are not bound to be adversaries. we should seek common ground based on shared interests.

russia, for instance, has also seen the horror of islamic terrorism. i believe an easing of tensions, and improved relations with russia from a position of strength only is possible, absolutely possible. common sense says this cycle, this horrible cycle of hostility must end and ideally will end soon. good for both countries.

some say the russians won’t be reasonable. i intend to find out. if we can’t make a deal under my administration, a deal that’s great — not good, great — for america, but also good for russia, then we will quickly walk from the table. it’s as simple as that. we’re going to find out.

fixing our relations with china is another important step — and really toward creating an even more prosperous period of time. china respects strength and by letting them take advantage of us economically, which they are doing like never before, we have lost all of their respect.

we have a massive trade deficit with china, a deficit that we have to find a way quickly, and i mean quickly, to balance. a strong and smart america is an america that will find a better friend in china, better than we have right now. look at what china is doing in the south china sea. they’re not supposed to be doing it.
no respect for this country or this president. we can both benefit or we can both go our separate ways. if need be, that’s what’s going to have to happen.

after i’m elected president, i will also call for a summit with our nato allies and a separate summit with our asian allies. in these summits, we will not only discuss a rebalancing of financial commitments, but take a fresh look at how we can adopt new strategies for tackling our common challenges. for instance, we will discuss how we can upgrade nato’s outdated mission and structure, grown out of the cold war to confront our shared challenges, including migration and islamic terrorism.



i will not hesitate to deploy military force when there is no alternative. but if america fights, it must only fight to win.



i will never sent our finest into battle unless necessary, and i mean absolutely necessary, and will only do so if we have a plan for victory with a capital v.



our goal is peace and prosperity, not war and destruction. the best way to achieve those goals is through a disciplined, deliberate and consistent foreign policy. with president obama and secretary clinton we’ve had the exact opposite — a reckless, rudderless and aimless foreign policy, one that has blazed the path of destruction in its wake.

after losing thousands of lives and spending trillions of dollars, we are in far worst shape in the middle east than ever, ever before. i challenge anyone to explain the strategic foreign policy vision of obama/clinton. it has been a complete and total disaster.

i will also be prepared to deploy america’s economic resources. financial leverage and sanctions can be very, very persuasive, but we need to use them selectively and with total determination. our power will be used if others do not play by the rules. in other words, if they do not treat us fairly. our friends and enemies must know that if i draw a line in the sand, i will enforce that line in the sand. believe me.



however, unlike other candidates for the presidency, war and aggression will not be my first instinct. you cannot have a foreign policy without diplomacy. a superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength. although not in government service, i was totally against the war in iraq, very proudly, saying for many years that it would destabilize the middle east. sadly, i was correct, and the biggest beneficiary has been has been iran, who is systematically taking over iraq and gaining access to their very rich oil reserves, something it has wanted to do for decades.

and now, to top it off, we have isis. my goal is to establish a foreign policy that will endure for several generations. that’s why i also look and have to look for talented experts with approaches and practical ideas, rather than surrounding myself with those who have perfect résumés but very little to brag about except responsibility for a long history of failed policies and continued losses at war. we have to look to new people.



we have to look to new people because many of the old people frankly don’t know what they’re doing, even though they may look awfully good writing in the new york times or being watched on television.

finally, i will work with our allies to reinvigorate western values and institutions. instead of trying to spread universal values that not everybody shares or wants, we should understand that strengthening and promoting western civilization and its accomplishments will do more to inspire positive reforms around the world than military interventions.



these are my goals as president. i will seek a foreign policy that all americans, whatever their party, can support, so important, and which our friends and allies will respect and totally welcome. the world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies, that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies, that’s what we want. we want them to be our allies.

we want the world to be — we want to bring peace to the world. too much destruction out there, too many destructive weapons. the power of weaponry is the single biggest problem that we have today in the world.

to achieve these goals, americans must have confidence in their country and its leadership. again, many americans must wonder why we our politicians seem more interested in defending the borders of foreign countries than in defending their own. americans.



americans must know that we’re putting the american people first again on trade.



so true. on trade, on immigration, on foreign policy. the jobs, incomes and security of the american worker will always be my first priority.



no country has ever prospered that failed to put its own interests first. both our friends and our enemies put their countries above ours and we, while being fair to them, must start doing the same. we will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism. the nation-state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony. i am skeptical of international unions that tie us up and bring america down and will never enter.



and under my administration, we will never enter america into any agreement that reduces our ability to control our own affairs.



nafta, as an example, has been a total disaster for the united states and has emptied our states — literally emptied our states of our manufacturing and our jobs. and i’ve just gotten to see it. i’ve toured pennsylvania. i’ve toured new york. i’ve toured so many of the states. they have been cleaned out. their manufacturing is gone.

never again, only the reverse — and i have to say this strongly — never again; only the reverse will happen. we will keep our jobs and bring in new ones. there will be consequences for the companies that leave the united states only to exploit it later. they fire the people. they take advantage of the united states. there will be consequences for those companies. never again.

under a trump administration, no american citizen will ever again feel that their needs come second to the citizens of a foreign country.



i will view as president the world through the clear lens of american interests. i will be america’s greatest defender and most loyal champion. we will not apologize for becoming successful again, but will instead embrace the unique heritage that makes us who we are.

the world is most peaceful and most prosperous when america is strongest. america will continue and continue forever to play the role of peacemaker. we will always help save lives and indeed humanity itself, but to play the role, we must make america strong again.



and always — always, always, we must make, and we have to look at it from every angle, and we have no choice, we must make america respected again. we must make america truly wealthy again. and we must — we have to and we will make america great again. and if we do that — and if we do that, perhaps this century can be the most peaceful and prosperous the world has ever, ever known. thank you very much, everybody. i appreciate it. thank you.



thank you very much.



thank you.

thank you for the opportunity to speak to you, and thank you to the center for the national interest for honoring me with this invitation.

i would like to talk today about how to develop a new foreign policy direction for our country – one that replaces randomness with purpose, ideology with strategy, and chaos with peace.

it is time to shake the rust off of america’s foreign policy. it's time to invite new voices and new visions into the fold.

the direction i will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle. my foreign policy will always put the interests of the american people, and american security, above all else. that will be the foundation of every decision that i will make.

america first will be the major and overriding theme of my administration.

but to chart our path forward, we must first briefly look back.

we have a lot to be proud of. in the 1940s we saved the world. the greatest generation beat back the nazis and the japanese imperialists.

then we saved the world again, this time from totalitarian communism. the cold war lasted for decades, but we won.

democrats and republicans working together got mr. gorbachev to heed the words of president reagan when he said: "tear down this wall."

history will not forget what we did.

unfortunately, after the cold war, our foreign policy veered badly off course. we failed to develop a new vision for a new time. in fact, as time went on, our foreign policy began to make less and less sense.

logic was replaced with foolishness and arrogance, and this led to one foreign policy disaster after another.

we went from mistakes in iraq to egypt to libya, to president obama’s line in the sand in syria. each of these actions have helped to throw the region into chaos, and gave isis the space it needs to grow and prosper.

it all began with the dangerous idea that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a western democracy.

a hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. like, little. look at my hands. they’re fine. nobody other than graydon carter years ago used to use that. my hands are normal hands. during a debate, he was losing, and he said, "oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means." this was not me. this was rubio that said, "he has small hands and you know what that means." okay? so, he started it. so, what i said a couple of days later ... and what happened is i was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, "mr. trump, you have strong hands. you have good-sized hands." and then another one would say, "you have great hands, mr. trump, i had no idea." i said, "what do you mean?" he said, "i thought you were like deformed, and i thought you had small hands." i had fifty people ... is that a correct statement? i mean people were writing, "how are mr. trump’s hands?" my hands are fine. you know, my hands are normal. slightly large, actually. in fact, i buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? no, but i did this because everybody was saying to me, "oh, your hands are very nice. they are normal." so rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say ... now i was hitting him pretty hard. he wanted to do his don rickles stuff and it didn’t work out. obviously, it didn’t work too well. but one of the things he said was "he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else." you can look it up. i didn’t say it.

 i don’t want people to go around thinking that i have a problem. i’m telling you, ruth, i had so many people. i would say 25, 30 people would tell me ... every time i’d shake people’s hand, "oh, you have nice hands." why shouldn’t i? and, by the way, by saying that i solved the problem. nobody questions ... i even held up my hands, and said, "look, take a look at that hand."

  i don’t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. he said, ‘donald trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.’ i didn’t say that. and all i did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when christie made him look bad, i gave him the– a little recap and i said, and i said, and i had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because i thought he was going to faint. and everybody took it fine. whether it was presidential or not i can’t tell you. i can just say that what he said was a lie. and everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after i said that, they never did. and then i held up the hand, i showed people the hand. you know, when i’ve got a big audience. so yeah, i think it’s not a question of presidential ...

  oh boy. we love nevada. we love nevada. thank you. thank you. oh this is a great place. thank you very much. great evening. we will be celebrating for a long time tonight. have a good time. have a good time.
you know we weren’t expecting—a couple of months ago, we weren’t expecting to win this one, you know that, right? we weren’t. of course if you listen to the pundits, we weren’t expected to win too much, and now we’re winning, winning, winning the country. and soon the country’s going to start winning, winning, winning. so i want to thank the volunteers. they’ve been unbelievable. these people, they work like endlessly, endlessly. we’re not going to forget it. and we’ve had some great numbers coming out of texas, and amazing numbers coming out of tennessee and georgia and arkansas and then in a couple of weeks later florida. we love florida so. we’re going to do very well in ohio. we’re beating the governor. it’s always nice to be beating the governor. and michigan—the whole thing. it’s going to be an amazing two months.
we might not even need the two months, folks, to be honest. so tonight we had 45 to 46%, and tomorrow you’d hear them say, you know, if they could just take the other candidates and add them up, and if you could add them up because you know the other candidates amount to 55%. so if they could—they keep forgetting that when people drop out, we’re going to get a lot of votes. you know they keep forgetting.
so i want to begin by thanking my boys, eric has been all over the place making speeches. he’s getting better than me so i’m a little jealous. and don went to _____, you were all over, right?
he loves the rifle stuff. this is serious rifle. this is serious nra, both of them, both of them. we love the second amendment folks. nobody loves it more than us, so just remember that.
and corey and hope, the staff, the whole group, and charles and dan and what a group we have. i want to just thank a couple of friends of mine that are here, the owner of this incredible hotel, mr. and mrs. phil ruffin, stand up. great guy. phil said, "donald,"—like for the last three months he’s driving me crazy, he said—"donald, i want to put $10 million into your campaign." i said, "phil i don’t want your money. i don’t want to do it. i’m self funding." every time i see him. it’s hard for me to turn down money because that’s what i’ve done in my whole life. i grab and grab and grab. you know i get greedy. i want money, money.
i’ll tell you what we’re going to do, right? we get greedy, right? now we’re going to get greedy for the united states. we’re going to grab and grab and grab. we’re going to bring in so much money and so much everything. we’re going to make america great again, folks, i’m telling you folks, we’re going to make america great again.
and another great friend of mine, someone respected by everybody, a great friend of phil too—mr. and mrs. steve wynn. stand up, steve. stand up. two great people. steve is always calling. he’s always got advice, right steve? "donald i think you should do this and that." his advice i like to listen to, i’ll be honest. so phil and steve and families, we appreciate it. you’ve been great friends. thank you, thank you.
so this was very exciting tonight. but i’ll tell you it looks like we won by a lot evangelicals. i love evangelicals, and i have to tell you pastor [robert] jeffress has been so incredible on television and elsewhere. he has been great. and as you know liberty university—do we love liberty university? huh? jerry falwell jr., an unbelievable guy, and he has been with us and with us from the beginning, and i want to thank jerry and his family. it’s been amazing, the relationship. so we won the evangelicals.
we won with young. we won with old. we won with highly educated. we won with poorly educated. i love the poorly educated. we’re the smartest people, we’re the most loyal people, and you know what i’m happy about? because i’ve been saying it for a long time. 46% were the hispanics—46%, no. 1 one with hispanics. i’m really happy about that.
so i’m very proud of you, this is an amazing night. i love the country, i love the country. we’re going in the wrong direction. we’re going to keep—as you know gitmo, we’re keeping that open, and we’re going to load it up with bad dudes. we’re going to load it up w a lot of bad dudes out there. we’re going to have our borders nice and strong. we’re going to build the wall, you know that. we’re going to build the wall. and i have a lot of respect from mexico, and you just heard we won hispanics. but let me tell you mexico is going to pay for the wall, right? it’s going to happen. it’s going to happen. they know it. i know it. we all know it.
we have a tremendous deficit. we have a trade deficit with mexico. they’ll pay for the wall. they’ll be very happy about it. believe me. i’ll talk to them. they’re going to be very, very thrilled. they’re going to be thrilled to be paying for the wall.
we’re going to be the smart people. we’re not going to be the people that get pushed around all over the place. we’re going to be the smart people. you’re going to be proud of your president, and you’re going to be even prouder of your country, ok?
so tonight folks, this was a great evening. i love this place. i love this state. i love las vegas. i have spent and invested so much money over here. trump international hotel—i keep telling steve we have the best hotel in las vegas. he’s fighting me all the time. but that’s ok. but i just want to say it’s a great state, and they have great people. and i was so proud. you know, i went to caucus. i was all over the place tonight. the people are amazing. the enthusiasm, it was unbelievable to see.
the people of this country are absolutely amazing. i love you folks very much. remember: make america great again. we’re going to do it, and it’s going to happen fast. thank you very much everybody. we love you. we love you.

wow. whoa. that is some group of people. thousands.

so nice, thank you very much. that’s really nice. thank you. it’s great to be at trump tower. it’s great to be in a wonderful city, new york. and it’s an honor to have everybody here. this is beyond anybody’s expectations. there’s been no crowd like this.

and, i can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. they didn’t know the air-conditioner didn’t work. they sweated like dogs.



they didn’t know the room was too big, because they didn’t have anybody there. how are they going to beat isis? i don’t think it’s gonna happen.



our country is in serious trouble. we don’t have victories anymore. we used to have victories, but we don’t have them. when was the last time anybody saw us beating, let’s say, china in a trade deal? they kill us. i beat china all the time. all the time.

when did we beat japan at anything? they send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? when was the last time you saw a chevrolet in tokyo? it doesn’t exist, folks. they beat us all the time.

when do we beat mexico at the border? they’re laughing at us, at our stupidity. and now they are beating us economically. they are not our friend, believe me. but they’re killing us economically.

the u.s. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.



thank you. it’s true, and these are the best and the finest. when mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. they’re not sending you. they’re not sending you. they’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. they’re bringing drugs. they’re bringing crime. they’re rapists. and some, i assume, are good people.

but i speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting. and it only makes common sense. it only makes common sense. they’re sending us not the right people.

it’s coming from more than mexico. it’s coming from all over south and latin america, and it’s coming probably — probably — from the middle east. but we don’t know. because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening. and it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast.

islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the middle east. they’ve become rich. i’m in competition with them.

they just built a hotel in syria. can you believe this? they built a hotel. when i have to build a hotel, i pay interest. they don’t have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left iraq, i said we should’ve taken.

so now isis has the oil, and what they don’t have, iran has. and in 19 — and i will tell you this, and i said it very strongly, years ago, i said — and i love the military, and i want to have the strongest military that we’ve ever had, and we need it more now than ever. but i said, "don’t hit iraq," because you’re going to totally destabilize the middle east. iran is going to take over the middle east, iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that iran is now taking over iraq. think of it. iran is taking over iraq, and they’re taking it over big league.

we spent $2 trillion in iraq, $2 trillion. we lost thousands of lives, thousands in iraq. we have wounded soldiers, who i love, i love — they’re great — all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.

and we have nothing. we can’t even go there. we have nothing. and every time we give iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it.

last week, i read 2,300 humvees — these are big vehicles — were left behind for the enemy. 2,000? you would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them.
last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product — a sign of strength, right? but not for us. it was below zero. whoever heard of this? it’s never below zero.

our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. but think of it, gdp below zero, horrible labor participation rate.

and our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. don’t believe the 5.6. don’t believe it.

that’s right. a lot of people up there can’t get jobs. they can’t get jobs, because there are no jobs, because china has our jobs and mexico has our jobs. they all have jobs.

but the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it’s a statistic that’s full of nonsense.

our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. even our nuclear arsenal doesn’t work.

it came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. they don’t know if it worked. and i thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, "that is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. they don’t know what they’re doing. they don’t know what they’re doing."

we have a disaster called the big lie: obamacare. obamacare.

yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. you have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it’s virtually useless. it’s virtually useless. it is a disaster.trump: and remember the $5 billion web site? $5 billion we spent on a web site, and to this day it doesn’t work. a $5 billion web site.

if and when the vatican is attacked by isis, which as everyone knows is isis’s ultimate trophy, i can promise you that the pope would have only wished and prayed that donald trump would have been president because this would not have happened. isis would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.

the mexican government and its leadership has made many disparaging remarks about me to the pope, because they want to continue to rip off the united states, both on trade and at the border, and they understand i am totally wise to them. the pope only heard one side of the story - he didn’t see the crime, the drug trafficking and the negative economic impact the current policies have on the united states. he doesn’t see how mexican leadership is outsmarting president obama and our leadership in every aspect of negotiation.

for a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. i am proud to be a christian and as president i will not allow christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened, unlike what is happening now, with our current president. no leader, especially a religious leader, should have the right to question another man’s religion or faith. they are using the pope as a pawn and they should be ashamed of themselves for doing so, especially when so many lives are involved and when illegal immigration is so rampant.

i have so many web sites, i have them all over the place. i hire people, they do a web site. it costs me $3. $5 billion web site.
well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. nothing’s gonna get done. they will not bring us — believe me — to the promised land. they will not.

as an example, i’ve been on the circuit making speeches, and i hear my fellow republicans. and they’re wonderful people. i like them. they all want me to support them. they don’t know how to bring it about. they come up to my office. i’m meeting with three of them in the next week. and they don’t know — "are you running? are you not running? could we have your support? what do we do? how do we do it?"

i like them. and i hear their speeches. and they don’t talk jobs and they don’t talk china. when was the last time you heard china is killing us? they’re devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn’t believe. it makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. they’re killing us.

but you don’t hear that from anybody else. you don’t hear it from anybody else. and i watch the speeches.
thank you.

i watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. and people are saying, "what’s going on? i just want a job. just get me a job. i don’t need the rhetoric. i want a job."

and that’s what’s happening. and it’s going to get worse, because remember, obamacare really kicks in in ’16, 2016. obama is going to be out playing golf. he might be on one of my courses. i would invite him, i actually would say. i have the best courses in the world, so i’d say, you what, if he wants to — i have one right next to the white house, right on the potomac. if he’d like to play, that’s fine.



in fact, i’d love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing.



but obamacare kicks in in 2016. really big league. it is going to be amazingly destructive. doctors are quitting. i have a friend who’s a doctor, and he said to me the other day, "donald, i never saw anything like it. i have more accountants than i have nurses. it’s a disaster. my patients are beside themselves. they had a plan that was good. they have no plan now."

we have to repeal obamacare, and it can be — and — and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. let it be for everybody. but much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. and we can do it.
so i’ve watched the politicians. i’ve dealt with them all my life. if you can’t make a good deal with a politician, then there’s something wrong with you. you’re certainly not very good. and that’s what we have= representing us. they will never make america great again. they don’t even have a chance. they’re controlled fully — they’re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully.

yes, they control them. hey, i have lobbyists. i have to tell you. i have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. they’re great. but you know what? it won’t happen. it won’t happen. because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it’s destroying our country. we have to stop, and it has to stop now.

we need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. our vets have been abandoned.



and we also need a cheerleader.

you know, when president obama was elected, i said, "well, the one thing, i think he’ll do well. i think he’ll be a great cheerleader for the country. i think he’d be a great spirit."

he was vibrant. he was young. i really thought that he would be a great cheerleader.

he’s not a leader. that’s true. you’re right about that.

but he wasn’t a cheerleader. he’s actually a negative force. he’s been a negative force. he wasn’t a cheerleader; he was the opposite.

we need somebody that can take the brand of the united states and make it great again. it’s not great again.

we need — we need somebody — we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. we can do that.



and, i will tell you, i love my life. i have a wonderful family. they’re saying, "dad, you’re going to do something that’s going to be so tough."

you know, all of my life, i’ve heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. just can’t happen. and yet that’s the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again.

so ladies and gentlemen...



i am officially running...



... for president of the united states, and we are going to make our country great again.



it can happen. our country has tremendous potential. we have tremendous people.

we have people that aren’t working. we have people that have no incentive to work. but they’re going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. and they’ll be proud, and they’ll love it, and they’ll make much more than they would’ve ever made, and they’ll be — they’ll be doing so well, and we’re going to be thriving as a country, thriving. it can happen.



i will be the greatest jobs president that god ever created. i tell you that.



i’ll bring back our jobs from china, from mexico, from japan, from so many places. i’ll bring back our jobs, and i’ll bring back our money.

right now, think of this: we owe china $1.3 trillion. we owe japan more than that. so they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal’s even better.

how stupid are our leaders? how stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? how stupid are they?



i’m going to tell you — thank you. i’m going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because i’m totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons.

number one, the people negotiating don’t have a clue. our president doesn’t have a clue. he’s a bad negotiator.

he’s the one that did bergdahl. we get bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there.

we get bergdahl. we get a traitor. we get a no-good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. that’s the negotiator we have.

take a look at the deal he’s making with iran. he makes that deal, israel maybe won’t exist very long. it’s a disaster, and we have to protect israel. but...
so we need people — i’m a free trader. but the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. if you don’t have talented people, if you don’t have great leadership, if you don’t have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible.

free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. we have people that aren’t smart. and we have people that are controlled by special interests. and it’s just not going to work.

so, here’s a couple of stories happened recently. a friend of mine is a great manufacturer. and, you know, china comes over and they dump all their stuff, and i buy it. i buy it, because, frankly, i have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again.

but with all our problems with russia, with all our problems with everything — everything, they got away with it again. and it’s impossible for our people here to compete.

so i want to tell you this story. a friend of mine who’s a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. he’s very upset. i said, "what’s your problem?"

he said, "you know, i make great product."

and i said, "i know. i know that because i buy the product."

he said, "i can’t get it into china. they won’t accept it. i sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. they talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it."

i said, "oh, wait a minute, that’s terrible. does anyone know this?"

he said, "yeah, they do it all the time with other people."

i said, "they send it back?"

"yeah. so i finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. they’re not supposed to be doing that. i told them."

now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there.

ask boeing. they wanted boeing’s secrets. they wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from boeing.

hey, i’m not saying they’re stupid. i like china. i sell apartments for — i just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from china. am i supposed to dislike them? i own a big chunk of the bank of america building at 1290 avenue of the americas, that i got from china in a war. very valuable.

i love china. the biggest bank in the world is from china. you know where their united states headquarters is located? in this building, in trump tower. i love china. people say, "oh, you don’t like china?"

no, i love them. but their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can’t sustain ourself with that. there’s too much — it’s like — it’s like take the new england patriots and tom brady and have them play your high school football team. that’s the difference between china’s leaders and our leaders.

they are ripping us. we are rebuilding china. we’re rebuilding many countries. china, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. they have bridges that make the george washington bridge look like small potatoes. and they’re all over the place.

we have all the cards, but we don’t know how to use them. we don’t even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don’t understand the game. we could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.

now they’re going militarily. they’re building a military island in the middle of the south china sea. a military island. now, our country could never do that because we’d have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn’t let our country — we would never build in an ocean. they built it in about one year, this massive military port.

they’re building up their military to a point that is very scary. you have a problem with isis. you have a bigger problem with china.

and, in my opinion, the new china, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is mexico.

so this man tells me about the manufacturing. i say, "that’s a terrible story. i hate to hear it."

but i have another one, ford.

so mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in tennessee, rips it out. everybody thought the deal was dead. reported it in the wall street journal recently. everybody thought it was a done deal. it’s going in and that’s going to be it, going into tennessee. great state, great people.trump: all of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they’re not going to tennessee. they’re gonna spend their $1 billion in mexico instead. not good.

now, ford announces a few weeks ago that ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in mexico. $2.5 billion, it’s going to be one of the largest in the world. ford. good company.

so i announced that i’m running for president. i would...



... one of the early things i would do, probably before i even got in — and i wouldn’t even use — you know, i have — i know the smartest negotiators in the world. i know the good ones. i know the bad ones. i know the overrated ones.

you get a lot of them that are overrated. they’re not good. they think they are. they get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed (ph). but they’re not good.

but i know the negotiators in the world, and i put them one for each country. believe me, folks. we will do very, very well, very, very well.

but i wouldn’t even waste my time with this one. i would call up the head of ford, who i know. if i was president, i’d say, "congratulations. i understand that you’re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in mexico and that you’re going to take your cars and sell them to the united states zero tax, just flow them across the border."

and you say to yourself, "how does that help us," right? "how does that help us? where is that good"? it’s not.

so i would say, "congratulations. that’s the good news. let me give you the bad news. every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that’s it.

now, here’s what is going to happen. if it’s not me in the position, it’s one of these politicians that we’re running against, you know, the 400 people that we’re (inaudible). and here’s what’s going to happen. they’re not so stupid. they know it’s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. but then they’re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for ford and say, "you can’t do that to ford, because ford takes care of me and i take care of you, and you can’t do that to ford."

and guess what? no problem. they’re going to build in mexico. they’re going to take away thousands of jobs. it’s very bad for us.

so under president trump, here’s what would happen:



the head of ford will call me back, i would say within an hour after i told them the bad news. but it could be he’d want to be cool, and he’ll wait until the next day. you know, they want to be a little cool.

and he’ll say, "please, please, please." he’ll beg for a little while, and i’ll say, "no interest." then he’ll call all sorts of political people, and i’ll say, "sorry, fellas. no interest," because i don’t need anybody’s money. it’s nice. i don’t need anybody’s money.

i’m using my own money. i’m not using the lobbyists. i’m not using donors. i don’t care. i’m really rich. i (inaudible).



and by the way, i’m not even saying that in a — that’s the kind of mindset, that’s the kind of thinking you need for this country.
so — because we got to make the country rich.

it sounds crass. somebody said, "oh, that’s crass." it’s not crass.

we got $18 trillion in debt. we got nothing but problems.

we got a military that needs equipment all over the place. we got nuclear weapons that are obsolete.

we’ve got nothing. we’ve got social security that’s going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn’t bring money into the country. all these other people want to cut the hell out of it. i’m not going to cut it at all; i’m going to bring money in, and we’re going to save it.



but here’s what’s going to happen:

after i’m called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after i’m called by all of the special interests and by the — the donors and by the lobbyists — and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero — i’ll get a call the next day from the head of ford. he’ll say. "please reconsider," i’ll say no.

he’ll say, "mr. president, we’ve decided to move the plant back to the united states, and we’re not going to build it in mexico." that’s it. they have no choice. they have no choice.

there are hundreds of things like that. i’ll give you another example.trump: saudi arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. i love the saudis. many are in this building. they make a billion dollars a day. whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. we say "we’re gonna protect." what are we doing? they’ve got nothing but money.

if the right person asked them, they’d pay a fortune. they wouldn’t be there except for us.

and believe me, you look at the border with yemen. you remember obama a year ago, yemen was a great victory. two weeks later, the place was blown up. everybody got out — and they kept our equipment.

they always keep our equipment. we ought to send used equipment, right? they always keep our equipment. we ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be — we ought to send our surplus. we’re always losing this gorgeous brand-new stuff.

but look at that border with saudi arabia. do you really think that these people are interested in yemen? saudi arabia without us is gone. they;re gone.

and i’m the one that made all of the right predictions about iraq. you know, all of these politicians that i’m running against now — it’s so nice to say i’m running as opposed to if i run, if i run. i’m running.



but all of these politicians that i’m running against now, they’re trying to disassociate. i mean, you looked at bush, it took him five days to answer the question on iraq. he couldn’t answer the question. he didn’t know. i said, "is he intelligent?"

then i looked at rubio. he was unable to answer the question, is iraq a good thing or bad thing? he didn’t know. he couldn’t answer the question.

how are these people gonna lead us? how are we gonna — how are we gonna go back and make it great again? we can’t. they don’t have a clue. they can’t lead us. they can’t. they can’t even answer simple questions. it was terrible.

but saudi arabia is in big, big trouble. now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. and i used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. they were smarter than our leaders.

there is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. because we need money. we’re dying. we’re dying. we need money. we have to do it. and we need the right people.

so ford will come back. they’ll all come back. and i will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that’s based on competence.

so the reporter said to me the other day, "but, mr. trump, you’re not a nice person. how can you get people to vote for you?"

i said, "i don’t know." i said, "i think that number one, i am a nice person. i give a lot of money away to charities and other things. i think i’m actually a very nice person."

but, i said, "this is going to be an election that’s based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. and they’re tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. and they’re tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. and some of them are like third world countries. but we’re becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. so one of the things i did, and i said, you know what i’ll do. i’ll do it. because a lot of people said, "he’ll never run. number one, he won’t want to give up his lifestyle."

they’re right about that, but i’m doing it.

number two, i’m a private company, so nobody knows what i’m worth. and the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth.

so i said, "that’s ok." i’m proud of my net worth. i’ve done an amazing job.

i started off — thank you — i started off in a small office with my father in brooklyn and queens, and my father said — and i love my father. i learned so much. he was a great negotiator. i learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. but i learned a lot.

but he used to say, "donald, don’t go into manhattan. that’s the big leagues. we don’t know anything about that. don’t do it."

i said, "i gotta go into manhattan. i gotta build those big buildings. i gotta do it, dad. i’ve gotta do it."

and after four or five years in brooklyn, i ventured into manhattan and did a lot of great deals — the grand hyatt hotel. i was responsible for the convention center on the west side. i did a lot of great deals, and i did them early and young. and now i’m building all over the world, and i love what i’m doing.

but they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, "well, donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he’s private and he’s probably not as successful as everybody thinks."

so i said to myself, you know, nobody’s ever going to know unless i run, because i’m really proud of my success. i really am.



i’ve employed — i’ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. that means medical. that means education. that means everything.

so a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it’s big and complex, and they’ve put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. but everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don’t extensions or anything. we’ll be filing it right on time. we don’t need anything.



and it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, "he had assets of $9 billion." so i said (ph), "no, that’s the wrong number. that’s the wrong number. not assets."

so they put together this. and before i say it, i have to say this. i made it the old-fashioned way. it’s real estate. you know, it’s real estate.

it’s labor, and it’s unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren’t in unions, and it’s all over the place and building all over the world.

and i have assets — big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected — 9 billion 240 million dollars.

and i have liabilities of about $500 million (ph). that’s long-term debt, very low interest rates.

in fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, "donald, you don’t have enough borrowings. could we loan you $4 billion"? i said, "i don’t need it. i don’t want it. and i’ve been there. i don’t want it."

but in two seconds, they give me whatever i wanted. so i have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it’ll be well-over $10 billion. but here, a total net worth of — net worth, not assets, not — a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets — trump tower, 1290 avenue of the americas, bank of america building in san francisco, 40 wall street, sometimes referred to as the trump building right opposite the new york — many other places all over the world.

so the total is $8,737,540,00.

now i’m not doing that...



i’m not doing that to brag, because you know what? i don’t have to brag. i don’t have to, believe it or not.

i’m doing that to say that that’s the kind of thinking our country needs. we need that thinking. we have the opposite thinking.

we have losers. we have losers. we have people that don’t have it. we have people that are morally corrupt. we have people that are selling this country down the drain.

so i put together this statement, and the only reason i’m telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years — you know, we’re at $8 trillion now. we’re soon going to be at $20 trillion.trump: according to the economists — who i’m not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they’re saying — that $24 trillion — we’re very close — that’s the point of no return. $24 trillion. we will be there soon. that’s when we become greece. that’s when we become a country that’s unsalvageable. and we’re gonna be there very soon. we’re gonna be there very soon.

i will immediately terminate president obama’s illegal executive order on immigration, immediately.



fully support and back up the second amendment.



now, it’s very interesting. today i heard it. through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. and a woman was on television this morning, and she said, "you know, mr. trump," and she was telling other people, and i actually called her, and she said, "you know, mr. trump, i always was against guns. i didn’t want guns. and now since this happened" — it’s up in the prison area — "my husband and i are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. we now have a gun on every table. we’re ready to start shooting."

i said, "very interesting."

so protect the second amendment.



end — end common core. common core should — it is a disaster. bush is totally in favor of common core. i don’t see how he can possibly get the nomination. he’s weak on immigration. he’s in favor of common core. how the hell can you vote for this guy? you just can’t do it. we have to end — education has to be local.

rebuild the country’s infrastructure.

nobody can do that like me. believe me. it will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.

i look at the roads being built all over the country, and i say i can build those things for one-third. what they do is unbelievable, how bad.

you know, we’re building on pennsylvania avenue, the old post office, we’re converting it into one of the world’s great hotels. it’s gonna be the best hotel in washington, d.c. we got it from the general services administration in washington. the obama administration. we got it. it was the most highly sought after — or one of them, but i think the most highly sought after project in the history of general services. we got it. people were shocked, trump got it.

well, i got it for two reasons. number one, we’re really good. number two, we had a really good plan. and i’ll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. because the general services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. and they wanted to make sure it got built.

so we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. you come into la guardia airport, it’s like we’re in a third world country. you look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. they throw down asphalt, and they throw.

you look at these airports, we are like a third world country. and i come in from china and i come in from qatar and i come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. you come to back to this country and you have lax, disaster. you have all of these disastrous airports. we have to rebuild our infrastructure.

save medicare, medicaid and social security without cuts. have to do it.



get rid of the fraud. get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. people have been paying it for years. and now many of these candidates want to cut it. you save it by making the united states, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that’s being lost.

renegotiate our foreign trade deals.

reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we’re in a bubble. we have artificially low interest rates. we have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but i still hate to see what’s happening. we have a stock market that is so bloated.

be careful of a bubble because what you’ve seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. so be very, very careful.

and strengthen our military and take care of our vets. so, so important.


chris, thank you very much. i appreciate it.
this has been an amazing evening. already, we’ve won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine.

it’s really been — it’s really been great.
i want to congratulation ted on the winning of texas. he worked hard on he — i know how hard he worked actually, and so i congratulate ted cruz on that win. that was an excellent win.
we’re going to make america great again, folks. we’re going to make it great again.
and, you know, i watched hillary’s speech and she’s talking about wages have been poor and everything’s poor and everything’s doing badly, but we’re going to make it — she’s been there for so long. i mean, if she hasn’t straightened it out by now, she’s not going to straighten it out in the next four years. it’s just going to become worse and worse. she wants to make america whole again and i’m trying to figure out what is that all about. make america great again is going to be much better than making america whole again.
so i just want to say that this was an exciting evening. it’s so great to be in florida. it’s so great to be at mar-a-lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody.

i know it was a very tough night for marco rubio. he had a tough night but he worked hard. he spent a lot of money. he is a lightweight, as i’ve said many times before. but you know what? we’re going to go to florida, we’re going to spend so much time in florida. we’ve got about a 20-point lead. i know that a lot of groups, a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want, they’re going to put $20 million or $25 million into it over the next two weeks, from what just came over the wires. and frankly, i think that’s fine. as far as i’m concerned, it’s fine. and if he wins, they’ll have totally controlled — total control. but he’s not going anywhere anyway, but we’ll see what happens. but we’re going to spend a lot of time in florida.
the virginia one was just a great win because it’s a place that is just spectacular and a place that we have big investments in, as we have in florida. remember, we have thousands of employees in florida, all along miami, doral and mar-a-lago and so many other places. and it’s been an amazing place to invest. it’s been amazing to have so many wonderful employees, so many of whom are here tonight, really urging us on.
and you know, i have thousands of employees all over the country, actually, all over the world but for purposes of tonight, we’ll just say all over the country. and it’s been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly.
recent articles came out talking about how great a company we built, and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation. i mean, our nation is in serious trouble. we’re being chilled on trade, absolutely destroyed. china is just taking advantage of us. i have nothing against china. i have great respect for china, but their leaders are too smart for our leaders. our leaders don’t have a clue and the trade deficits at $400 billion and $500 are too much. no country can sustain that kind of trade deficit. it won’t be that way for long. we have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and, believe me, we’re going to redo those trade deals and it’s going to be a thing of beauty.
you look at countries like mexico, where they’re killing us on the border, absolutely destroying us on the border. they’re destroying us in terms of economic development. companies like carrier air conditioner just moving into mexico. ford, moving into mexico. nabisco, closing up shop in chicago and moving into mexico. we have to stop it, folks. i know how to stop it. we’re going to create jobs. we’re going to create jobs like you’ve never seen.
we’re going to lower taxes. i have a plan that larry kudlow and so many others think is the best plan they’ve seen. we’re going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class. the middle class has been forgotten in our country. it really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we’re all so proud of, but we’ve forgotten the middle class. so we’re going to lower taxes.
we’re lowering taxes on business. you look at all the companies that are moving out. when you see pfizer moving to ireland and you see so many other companies, constantly now they’re leaving. they used to move from new york to florida, or they’d move from new jersey to someplace else, chris. but now they’re moving from here —  — not that many people are leaving new jersey. but chris understands the problem, fully understands. now they’re leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world. we can’t let that happen.
we’ve lost our manufacturing jobs. we’ve lost our manufacturing. millions and millions of jobs, thousands and thousands and thousands of plants, manufacturing plants, warehouses. i mean, we are losing so much. we can’t let it happen.
i tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders caterpillar. and recently, he ordered komatsu tractors from japan because they’ve cut the yen. they’ve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for caterpillar to compete. and i don’t want that to happen. that’s not going to happen. they shouldn’t be allowed to do it.
we have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source. we have great, great power. the problem is we have politicians who truly, truly, truly don’t know what they’re doing. so we’re going to work very, very hard.
i’m so honored by this evening. if you would’ve told me on june 16th, when i was with my wife, melania, and we came down the escalator in trump tower and it looked, literally, well, a little bit like this. you have a lot of cameras here tonight.

it looked, literally, like the academy awards. i never saw so many cameras in my life. and it takes courage to run. i’ll tell you what, it takes a lot of courage to run for president. i’ve never done this before. i’ve been a job-producer. i’ve done a lot of things but this is something i’ve never done, but i felt we had to do it. when you look at the incompetence of the iran deal, where we give $150 billion, we get absolutely nothing. when you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military, which is really being depleted rapidly, depleted. we’re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and nobody, nobody, nobody is going to mess with us, folks, nobody.

so it’s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight. and if you want, press, i think we told you before we’d be okay if you want to ask a few questions.
yes, go ahead.

well, they can always do that and then they’ll — then they’ll just lose everything and that would be the — that would be the work of a loser.
but let me just explain something. if you’ve seen what’s happened, whether you go to south carolina, where i had a huge victory, where we had a tremendous victory in new hampshire, tremendous in nevada, you look at what’s happened, and tonight, of course, is the best of all. i mean, right now, they’re projected i guess six, but we could be seven, eight, nine, and major states. it’s georgia, alabama, massachusetts — (cheers) — tennessee, virginia. and you know, these are amazing states and we’re going to probably get a lot more. in fact, we’re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers.
but i will say this. look, we have expanded the republican party. when you look at what’s happened in south carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got, in terms of extra people coming in. they came from the democratic party, or the democrat party, and they’re democrats and they’re long-time democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched. and they were independents. and we’ve actually expanded the party. look at the number of votes we had in that area, as an example. four years ago, they had 390,000 or so votes. we doubled it. we were almost 800,000. whereas the democrats went down. there’s much less enthusiasm for the democrats.
so i — look, i’m a unifier. i know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe, but believe me, i am a unifier. once we get all of this finished, i’m going to go after one person, that’s hillary clinton, on the assumption she’s allowed to run, which is a big assumption. i don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run. and i think that’s, frankly, going to be an easy race. you see the polls. i beat hillary in many polls. i know one thing. i don’t think marco is going to be able to beat her. i don’t think — in all fairness, i think ted’s going to have a very hard time. but ted at least has a shot because at least he’s won a little bit.
so i just tell you this. we are going to be a much finer party, a much — we’re going to be a unified party, i mean, to be honest with you. and we are going to be a much bigger party, and you can see that happening. we’re going to be a much bigger party. our party is expanding. and all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where i’ve won and just look — we’ve gone from x number to a much larger number. that hasn’t happened to the republican party in many, many decades. so i think we’re going to be more inclusive. i think we’re going to be more unified and i think we’re going to be a much bigger party, and i think we’re going to win in november. ok, yeah?

i’m just doing what’s right. look, planned parenthood has done very good work for some — for many, many — for millions of women. and i’ll say it and i know a lot of the so-called conservatives, they say that’s really — because i’m a conservative, but i’m a common-sense conservative. but millions of women have been helped by planned parenthood. but we’re not going to allow and we’re not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at planned parenthood, and we understand that and i’ve said it loud and clear. but — and we’ll see what happens. but planned parenthood — millions of people — and i’ve had thousands of letters from women that have been helped. and this wasn’t a setup. this was people writing letters. i’m going to be really good for women. i’m going to be good for women’s health issues. it’s very important to me, very important to me.
 and maybe that’s not a perfect conservative view, but i can tell you one thing. i’m more conservative than anybody on the military, on taking care of our vets, on the border, on the wall, on getting rid of obamacare and coming up with something much, much better, and certainly, getting rid of common core and bringing education to a local level so that you’re going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely starved for proper education.
so sarah, i mean, you know, you can call it what you want, but i am a truth-teller and i will tell the truth, ok?
yeah, go ahead, finish it.

i feel awfully good. i mean, i’m watching your people — i’m watching your people on — and i’m going to be very nice, i’m going to be very nice — i’m watching your people on cnn and i’m watching the fox people and i’m watching the msnbc people, too, ok? see? i’m becoming diplomatic.  and they are certainly being very nice to me tonight. i mean, you know, they’re being very strong. and they are, they’re declaring marco rubio the big loser of the night, which is true. he didn’t win anything. he hasn’t won anything, period.
and by the way, and i have to tell you — and he was very, very nasty. i’ve never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty, but he’s got a right to be nasty. he hasn’t won anything and he’s not going to win very much.
but i do congratulate ted because i know how hard ted worked on texas and it’s a big get. now i also did very well in texas. i came in second. and one of the things my son, eric, told me, which i didn’t even realize, is that not only did i win most of the states — and some are coming in and i’m expected to win them — but i came in second — i came in no worse than second. so it wasn’t like i won and then i disappeared. the worst i had was a second. so i’m very, very honored by the turnout, ok?
yes, go ahead.

right. oh, they’re totally wrong. look, i disavowed. i disavowed when i — in fact, chris is my number one — chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign. he called me. he said, "donald, what you’ve got is a movement." we spoke today in kentucky. you’ve never seen a crowd like that. that had to be 20,000 people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible. and every place we’re speaking, if we have 10,000 people it’s like a small group. we had 35,000 people the other day in alabama. and when chris called, he said this is a movement; this is something like i’ve never seen. and in all fairness to the press, a lot of the press have said the same thing. they’ve never seen what’s happening right now. they’ve never seen anything like it. and i’m just honored by it.
now, when chris joined, we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question. i said i disavow. now, right after the program that we’re talking about — and i thought it was clear, but you know, we’re talking about groups, groups, groups. i do have to know the name of the group because, who knows? i mean, they have to give me the name of the group. but right after, when i reviewed it, i put out a tweet and i put out on facebook that i totally disavow. now everybody knew i did that but the press refused to look at that. it was right after. and i disavowed then; i disavowed today on abc with george stephanopoulos, i disavowed again. i mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow? but i disavow and hopefully it’s the final time i have to do it. but if you look at facebook and if you look at twitter, right after the show i put out a statement because i want everybody to be sure.
yes, go ahead.

no, it’s not, but there is always going to be some negotiation, and it’s going to be a good negotiation, not a bad negotiation. it’s going to be a negotiation where we’ll start at certain levels and hopefully i will make a great deal, and lots of great deals, for the american people.
so you know, look, you can’t go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time, executive orders, he’s done executive order, executive order. it’s almost like, i don’t even know. does he ever go a deal with congress anymore? does he ever speak to the senate? does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done?
you know, a good example of this, in all fairness, is something that i — is very, very important to me; corporate inversion. carl icahn, who’s a friend of mine who endorsed me, great businessman, he — it bothers him so much he calls me about it all the time, where we’re losing companies. and we’re losing for two reasons. we’re losing for a lot of reasons but the taxes are too high. we have the highest — we’re the highest taxed nation in the world.
and very importantly, they have trillions, for companies, trillions of dollars outside of this country. the democrats agree it should be brought back in. the republicans agree it should be brought back in. everybody agrees it should be brought back in. i could sit in a room — or the oval office — for a period of, literally, a half hour and i really believe i could get everybody — every single — you know, it’s one thing they don’t agree on health care or they don’t agree on common core or they don’t agree on other things and they’ll fight. here’s something every single — i mean, almost everybody agrees. these trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country.
the president can’t make a deal. the reason is he doesn’t know how to make a deal, probably doesn’t work at it, probably doesn’t care, but you’re talking about tremendous number of — tremendous amounts of money. so when you have something that everybody wants and you can’t make a deal, there’s something going on that’s really wrong. and what it means is you have the wrong leader.
yes?

well, look, everything — we are going to have a wall. i can tell you we are going to have a wall. i watched the ex-president of mexico, the arrogance of this man. and i get along great with hispanics. you saw in nevada, i won in the poll, the hispanic vote. i have thousands of people that work for me right now that are hispanic. i’ve had thousands and thousands over my lifetime. these are great people. the mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders and you saw it. vincente fox, first of all, he used a word that you should never have — if i ever used that word you folks would’ve never, ever, ever let me get away with it. nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word. but he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were going to pay for the wall. mexico is going to pay for the wall. we have a trade deficit with mexico of $58 billion a year — $58 billion. the wall is going to cost $10 billion. it’s so easy. i’ve had these guys that i’m on the stage with go you don’t really mean mexico is going to pay for the wall. one — as sure as you’re standing there, 100 percent, mexico’s going to pay, 100 percent.

and the reason is i’m a businessman. i know how to do this. politicians are all talk, no action. it’s not going to — except for chris christie, of course.  it’s not — look, it’s not going to happen. it’s not going to happen with these people.
so when you think of it — and then they say you’ll never be able to build a wall. well, it’s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles. the great wall of china, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn’t have caterpillar tractors, because i only want to use caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or john deere. i buy a lot of equipment from john deere. i love john deere, too. but they didn’t have tractors. they didn’t have cranes. they didn’t have excavation equipment. the wall is 13,000 miles long. we need 1,000 miles and we have all of the materials. we can do that so beautifully. and this is going to be a serious wall. this is going to be high wall. this is going to be a very serious wall.
we’re going to stop drugs from coming into new hampshire. you know, when i won new hampshire, those people were so incredible to me. and when you go, you wouldn’t believe it because it’s so bucolic, so beautiful. you look at the fields and you look at everything, it’s so beautiful. and yet, you go to a meeting in new hampshire, their number one problem, their number one problem is heroine. the heroine is pouring in and they have so many of their young people and other people addicted. and i told them i’m going to stop it. i’m going to stop it. we’re going to have a strong border, and i mean strong.
and by the way, speaking of people, people are going to come in and they’re going to come into this country, but they’re going to come in legally, ok?

i’ve got to find out what’s going on. we’ve got a big problem. we have a big, big problem. i’ll tell it like it is. we have a big, big problem. we’ve got to figure it out. we’re going to figure it out. radical islamic terrorism, big, big problem, not only for us. you take a look at germany, you take a look at sweden, you take a look at brussels. you look at some of these places, it’s like a disaster. and we’re not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are, we have no idea where they come from, they have no paperwork, they’re young and they’re strong. you look at that migration line; they’re young, they’re strong, they’re powerful. and you say why aren’t they back fighting for their country?
now, with all of that being said, i feel strongly — i have a bigger heart than anybody. we’re going to build a safe zone. it’s going to be in syria. and i’m going to get the gulf states, who have more money than anybody — we’ve got to loosen up their wallets a little bit. we’re going to get — but they’re not accepting people. we’re going to get — wait, wait, wait. we’re going to get the gulf states to pay for it because they should.

oh, we’re going to bring them back. we’re going to bring them back. look, i’m telling you — you know how i’m going to bring them back? first of all, we’re going to do great with the african- americans, and you see that in the polls where i had in one poll where i’m 25 percent. and one of the commentators, who i think is standing right at the back of the room in the corner, said, you know, if donald trump gets 25 percent of the african-american vote, this election is over. you watch. and the reason i’m getting that — and i’m going to do great with the hispanics. i’m going to do great with virtually every group. the reason is i’m going to bring jobs back. i’m going to get apple to start making their computers and their iphones on our land, not in china. how does it help us when they make it in china?

well, look, i always liked marco until about a week ago when he decided to go hostile. he decided to become don rickles, ok? but don rickles has a lot more talent. honestly, i did, i always liked him but he became — you know, somebody told him you’re losing very badly. the only way you can possibly win, take the hail mary, they called it a hail mary, the folks in the back, and go hostile. it’s hurt him. in fact, one of the newscasts tonight said he went down 15 or 20 percent. it’s really hurt him.
but look, i’m not going to tell him what to do. i’m not going to tell anybody what to do. you have to run. he had a bad night, according to cnn, fox. i watched their broadcasts. they say the loser of the night was marco rubio and it’s true. he didn’t win anything. he hasn’t won. i mean, at least you can say that ted has won something, and you know, marco has not won. you’ve got to be able to win. you can’t talk. you know, these politicians, all talk, no action. you’ve got to be able to win something. he hasn’t won anything. and he actually hasn’t come very close. so we’ll see what happens.
yes, go ahead.

i’m going to be a good president for the world but we have a country that’s in big trouble. our infrastructure is going to hell, our roads, our highways, our schools, our hospitals, our airports. i go throughout the world. i mean, you go to qatar, you go to — some people say qatar, but you go to qatar, you go to any of — so many places. you go to different places in china, different places in asia, different places in the middle east, you look at some of the airports they have. you look at the roadways they have. you look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have. we’re like a third world country.
so i am going to be very good for the world. i’m going to get along with the world. you’re going to be very proud of me. even you will be very proud of me as a president. but we have to rebuild our country. our country is going to hell and people don’t understand that.
and hillary clinton doesn’t have a clue. she can’t do that. she’s talking about — i mean, one of the things that has really bothered me, i think one of the reasons i have such great support, is that people, you take a look, people in the middle-income groups are making less money today — less money than they made 12 years ago. and in her speech, she just said they’re making less money. well, she’s been there with obama for a long period of time. why hasn’t she done anything about it? practically everything that she was complaining about — she’s picked up what i say. the difference is she’s been there for a long period of time. why haven’t they done anything about it?
then you look at her record as secretary of state. it’s abysmal. you look at what’s going on with syria. you look at what’s going on with everything. it’s a disaster.
so we’re going to have an interesting period of time. i don’t know that she’s going to be allowed to run. what she did is a criminal act. if she’s allowed to run i would be very, very surprised. but if she’s allowed to run, honestly, it’ll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong. and what she did — (cheers) — let me just tell you, what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very, very big price.
ok, one or two more questions. yeah, go ahead, jeremy

at this moment, absolutely not, no. we either have a country or we don’t. we have a country, or we don’t. we have borders or we don’t have borders. and at this moment, the answer is absolutely not.

well, look, i don’t expect — i have a lot of respect for reince and for the group and i like the rnc and i don’t know that i’ve been treated fairly or not. i really don’t know. i can’t tell you that. but i can tell you that i do respect them.
what i really have is a great number of people. i have millions and millions of people. and when i was watching this broadcast just a little while ago, before i came in here because i wanted to see exactly where we were before i started speaking, i was amazed at the kind of numbers. the republicans have tremendous energy. the democrats don’t. they don’t have any energy. their numbers are down. our number are through the roof. and people are making the statements they’ve never seen, in modern times, a party that was so energized.
i think if somebody is doing as well as i’m doing — and i’m not just speaking for myself, whether it be me or anybody else — but if i’m going to win five — i’ve already won five, but maybe it could be six, seven, eight, nine. it could be nine, could win nine states tonight. if i’m going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers, and if i’m going to come in the worst is second in the two or three that i might not win, i think, you know, we’re a democracy. i think it’s awfully hard to say that’s not the person we want to lead the party, right? you know, it’s very hard.
but i really think that — i think it’s a great question, david, because i really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening, and everybody, is the republican party has become more dynamic. it’s become more diverse. we’re taking from the democrats. we’re taking from the independents. we have a lot more people. we have a lot more people. i mean, take a look at south carolina. look at the numbers. look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote. and then you look at — i was there and you had lines that went a mile long. and it was virtually more than doubled.
so we have a very, very dynamic party and i think we’re going to be able to unify the party. i hope to be able to get along with everybody. i don’t know paul ryan well but i hope to be able to get along with him. i do know mitch mcconnell a little bit but i hope to be able to get along with him. but remember this. i have millions and millions and millions of people. this isn’t like it’s a close match. i mean, it’s only too bad that winner didn’t take all, because if winner took all, this thing is over. we’re just having a celebration.

you know, we’re having a celebration.
so anyway, i would like to — look, i just want to end by thanking everybody. this has been an amazing period in my life. my wife just called and ivanka, as you know, is going to be having a baby very soon and she’s a special person and it’s going to be great and we look forward to that. she’s back in new york. she wanted to be here. they all wanted to be here but they’re with ivanka now and that could be, certainly, within the next week. but this this has been an amazing period of time. it’s been amazing for me, even from an educational standpoint. and i think, honestly, we’ve done something that almost nobody thought could be done and i’m very proud of it.
and i just want to leave you with this. i am a unifier. i would love to see the republican party and everybody get together and unify. and when we unify, there’s nobody, nobody that’s going to beat us.
thank you very much everybody. thank you.

thank you very much. thank you.

this is so — so incredible. —

 we — we have had, no matter where we go — you know, it’s a movement, folks. this is a movement.



no matter where we go, it’s amazing. we go to dallas. we go to oklahoma. we go all over. we went to, the other night, iowa — packed. every place — new hampshire, packed. every place we go to, it’s like this. it’s amazing. and just great, great people.



and they actually had to tell over 3,000 people, "go home." we’ll come back. we’ll do another one. but they had to go home. would you like to leave and we’ll let them come in? no?

i don’t think so, but we — they turned away a lot of people, which is too bad, actually. so maybe next time. i don’t know. i think this is the largest room. i know it’s a record for the room.



you know, it has to be a record because every inch of the room is taken with people, and they’re standing. they’re not sitting. so that’s great. i love — we love setting records. we want the country to set records, right?



so, you know, i — i do this, and i love to do it. and i talk about our success because that’s ultimately what it’s all about. i think we’re going to do fantastically well in iowa. i really think we’re going to do great there. and i could say, "oh, gee, if we came in the top four of five." i’m not — i’m looking to win everything. we want to run the table. we want to run it, because that sends a signal.

and, you know, we’ve been a little bit — we had to respond to hillary. she came out with that — she came out — remember, she wrote — she said, "he’s got a — he’s demonstrated a penchant" — i demonstrated — "a penchant for sexism." can you believe it? me? nobody respects women more than donald trump. that i can tell you.



and, you know, when she said that, i had no choice, because i didn’t start it. i had no choice. and i did have to mention her husband’s situation. ok?

(laughter)

and that is now the biggest story on television by a factor of 10. so, we have to do it. you can’t let people push you around. you can’t let people tell lies. you can’t do it.

 you know, it’s interesting. one of the polls came out from cnbc and they said that if it’s trump against hillary in the election, it will be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country. i can see that. i can see it.



and they said all of these people that are going to come in new, that never vote — they never vote, they don’t care — they’re going to mostly — i’ll tell you what, they’re going to vote for trump. that’s why they’re coming in, because they’re so fed up with the system — this corrupt, horrible system. they’re fed up with it and they’re fed up with those guys back there, the media.

trump: they are the worst.



no, no, no. they’re fed up. they’re fed up with the media. i mean, i’ve got — and you know, not all bad, but there’s so much dishonesty in the media. and i like to call it out. and one of the things that’s really been amazing to me, and such — it’s been so beautiful to watch — the level of genius in the public. they get it, you know? they really get it. they want to marginalize us, they want to do all of this and they want to make everybody look like, "oh, gee."

the level of genius — they fully understand. they know they’re crooked, they know they’re dishonest and they really — otherwise, who gets worse publicity than me?

(laughter)

and yet, i see a poll at 42 percent. and you know, you’re talking about 15, 16 people, started with 17. how are you? started with 17 people. and you know, i’d be happy with 42 if we had three, ok? not thrilled, i’d like to be that — over that 50 mark, but i think we’re doing really well.

and you know, it’s interesting, but the debates — ok. so the debates — thank — i love you too, darling.

(laughter)

i love you. i do. i love you. i love every — you know what? the rooms, no matter where, whether it’s stadiums or big ballrooms like this one, it’s amazing, and there’s love in the room. and i told — the other night, i said and a friend of mine, very, very successful guy who i would love to have negotiating against china. that’s what we need, not these hacks that we have.



no, no. i have guys ...



carl icahn endorsed me. great business man. we have — i have great, great business people that want to be involved. and we’re going to use — we have the best. we have the best in the world. we don’t use them. we use political hacks, we use special interest people that really don’t care about the country, they care about their deals.

this is going to change so fast. you know, last year, $500 billion trade deficit with china. think about it. you know what $500 billion is? you do — you do $100 bills, you would fill the room to the ceiling, $500 billion deficit — trade deficit with china. what are we? are we — yes, i guess the answer is certainly let’s not blame us.

our leaders are stupid and — and/or — you have to say and/or they have deals, because what’s happened is all of this money is being given to them by special interests, by all of these people, including lobbyists, and these lobbyists make our leaders do — our leaders, can you believe our leaders? this is what — but they make the leaders of our country do things that they don’t even want to do because they’ve given them tens and tens and tens of millions of dollars.

i look at this guy jeb bush. he spent $59 million on his campaign and he is down in the grave. he is nowhere. no, no. think of it. it’s got to be much more than that. it was actually $59 million a while ago. every time i turn on an add, i see an ad about trump. i mean, it’s not that bad an ad either. it’s like — you know.



if you’re going to do an ad, do an ad. but he’s a low-energy person. let’s face it. we don’t need low-energy. we need lots of energy.



but he spent — think of it. think of it. he spent $59 million. i spent nothing, right? nothing.



now, i’m going to be spending. you probably saw i’m going to spend — now, we’re going to start spending a lot of money because i don’t want to take any chances. you know, it’s — i love getting up — and for the last couple of months, i have been leading from practically the time i announced, right? and for the last — and leading a lot. i’m going to go over that because i go over (ph) polls. i love polls. i love polls.



now, when they — if they turn negative, i don’t like them.



and i promise, if they turn negative, i’m not going to be talking about them. in fact, i get criticized all the time. you’re always talking about your polls. one of these guys just got two. he’s at two. i’m at 42. and one of these guys who’s at two said, "he always talks about his polls and i don’t." i wouldn’t either if i had two, i swear i wouldn’t.



i wouldn’t. i wouldn’t do it at all. but you know, i love to tell the story where i have spent nothing and bush has spent $59 million, but much higher than that. that’s just — you know, because i see since then — i mean, just — you can’t turn on this television without these commercials. and fox — every two minutes it’s a commercial on trump.

you know what he did? it’s false advertising. so i killed him in the debate. according to reuters, according to everybody, drudge, who’s an amazing guy, by the way. if you don’t know drudge — matt drudge. right? he’s a great guy. but drudge, 46 percent. at 46 percent, you have 15 people. now, if you noticed a couple have dropped out. a couple or more.

but 15, 16 people — 46 percent. time magazine, 49 percent. think of it. slate, 51 percent. u.s. news and world report — 69 percent said i won the debate. i wont the debate, right?



pbs, public broadcasting system — 69 percent said trump won.



no, you know, it is amazing. we have washington times at 62 percent. cbs, 59 percent. fox, 62 percent — fox las vegas, 62 percent. so, they all say — then they go back home, after the debate. i like to see how did i do? did i look good? looking good is very important, right? sometimes, it is not as much like what you say, it’s how did you look?

oh, i looked good, didn’t sound too good, but that is ok. you wonder if that is a good trait. but i go home, and i watch, and the pundits will say — and they can’t totally kill me, because we know it is happening, we know what’s happening — well, mr. trump was ok tonight. he was — i won every single online poll, i won.

and then, here’s bush. so, bush does an ad. and he takes me — and he was talking about, you know, something, and manage — and then i killed him. i mean, he — by the way, i met 69 percent, he is at 1 percent, he got. he came in last.



he takes the ad — and i shouldn’t even talk about him. he’s down to two or three — i — but it bothers me when i see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me, a lot of it, right? i say, why is he doing this? doesn’t he have something better, he should go home.



just relax. you know, honestly, he should go home and relax. he shouldn’t be wasting his time. but it does. i say, why is this guy spending all this money? now he is spending it actually against a couple of other guys, they were also very weak and somewhere — but here is my ad. so, he made a statement, and after that, his spin people said, oh, he was great. he took on trump, he took on trump. i’m standing here, he’s over here. took on trump, he made a statement that was written by his pollster. you know? so, he would remember (ph) it.

he said, "mr. trump, why don’t you this?" i said, ok. then i gave him an answer. i said, "jeb, i’m at 42, you are at 2. right? it is a simple answer. you started off here, right next to me, and then you were there, then you were there, by the next time, you are going to be off the stage. right?



no, no, it’s true. and then — and then — and that was it. and so i responded. so, he asked me a question, question was fine. you know, professionally written. so, he asked me a question, good. i give him an answer, i blow him away. right. everyone says trump won the debate. everybody. and hat is it. so, the ad is him asking the question and i’m standing there like this, because i haven’t — in fact, you see in one of them, i’m just about ready to open my mouth.

but he doesn’t let me respond. that is almost false advertising, isn’t it? you know? so, i mentioned it, hillary is a disaster. i mean, hillary.

hillary is controlled by her money. so is jeb. so is — by the way, i’m the only one self-funding my campaign. i’m self-funding.



you know, one of the things that makes me happy. i heard one of my commentators this morning, said, "you know, i’ve been watching this stuff for 50 years and i’ve never seen anything like what has happened with trump. one of them actually said — one of them — i’m special. you’re special. i like you. i’m special.

isn’t that nice? that’s a very — every once in a while, somebody can say something that hits you. where are you? who said that? wow. so nice. thank you. that is a nice one. that’s like, you know, very once in a while, there is a statement that is either nice or brutal. i think low-energy was a brutal statement, right?

low-energy can be applied to hillary. i just don’t like to use the same thing twice on one of my enemies. right? because i consider them enemies. we view this as war. don’t we view this as war? it’s war.

it’s war. and so, you don’t like to use it. i hate to give it up. what?

 how are you going to help my little girl (ph), daughter?  oh, we are going to help your daughter. we are going to help the country, that’s called helping the daughter. we are going to help your country. so, here is the story. so, we are in a situation where we have incompetent leadership, where our trade deals are killing us, our military is not prepared. general odierno when he left, just recently, he said that we are less prepared than at any time that he can remember. and i think he went back tot he beginning, but let’s say second world war. ok? that’s enough.

and we should be very prepared now, because the world hates us. she has done a terrible job as secretary of state. think of it. putin comes out, he said, donald trump is brilliant, he is doing an amazing job, and he is leading the pack. ok, that’s nice.

 and she and my opponents — oh, isn’t it terrible that putin said — wouldn’t it be nice if we could get along with the world? wouldn’t it be? seriously. no, no, wouldn’t it be nice?



i mean, they want me to refute his statement. how dare you say i’m brilliant? how dare — that’s — who’s going to do that? and by the way, if he said it about anyone of them, they would have been very happy.

but the point is, we have to get along. the world has blown up around barack obama.

now, i don’t know if you saw his recent release. they were talking about the department of state, state department, and they said very strongly, you know, the things that they’ve done. well, they couldn’t find it because what have they done that’s good? and they said bringing peace to syria. did you see that?

so instead of saying they made a mistake — call it a typo, they made a mistake — they’re trying to justify it. well, we meant we’re working on it. can you believe — bringing peace to syria. the world is blowing up, the migration in syria — they say one of their achievements for the year is bringing peace to syria, and the whole world’s talking about it. it’s — the level of stupidity is incredible. i’m telling you. i used to use the word incompetent, now i just call them stupid.



i went to an ivy league school, i’m very highly educated. i know words, i had the best words. i have — but there’s no better word than stupid.



right? there is none. there is none.



there’s no — there’s no — there’s no word like that. so we are going to turn things around. but — and if we have hillary — i’ve got to tell you. i just saw where for the last week she’s been hitting me really hard with the women card, ok? really hard. and i had to say ok, that’s enough, that’s enough. and we did a strong number. she’s not going to win. any by the way, i love the concept — i love, love, love having a woman president. can’t be her. she’s horrible. she’s horrible.


 and you know really don’t — i’ll tell you who does not like — yeah, we’ll get ivanka. good. let’s do ivanka.



but i’ll tell you who doesn’t like hillary are women. women don’t like hillary.



i see it all the time. and always so theatrical; mr. trump said this and that and this. and you just — i actually — i shouldn’t do it. i just have to turn off the television so many times. she just gives me a headache.



but you know — although i think last night i gave her a big headache.



i can imagine — i can imagine those discussions. but you have to hit back hard, and you can’t let them push you around. and today, she gave a speech and she never even mentioned my name. you know, in the debate i was mentioned nine times, i mean everything. all of them. but her. i was mentioned nine times, none of the other candidates were mentioned. and then she came out with the sexism, which is so nonsense. and — but she’s playing that card. and then i had to hit her back, so i hit her back and i talked about her husband and the abuse of women and the tremendous abuse — no, it’s tremendous abuse.

i mean, you look at it, it’s tremendous abuse. and i talked about that. and now today, the television is going crazy, and she gets up, makes a speech and doesn’t even mention anything about me with sexism or anything else. i wonder why — i wonder why.



and remember this; it’s really important. a poll just came out where we’re tied, another one came out a couple of weeks ago, fox, where i’m leading by four or five points against her individually. we’re doing great. i haven’t even focused on her yet.

look at the people i’ve focused on. i don’t want to really knock them, i don’t want to mention their names. but, you know, of those people that are all gone, they were all people that attacked me. wouldn’t it be nice if our country could have that same thing? you attack and they’re, boom, gone. and if we could do it verbally —



— you know, if we could do it verbally that’s even better, right? you know, who wants to use our military? by the way, we are going to build the strongest, the best, the most powerful military ever. ever. ever.



and we’re going to take care of our vets, we’re going to take care of our vets —



— because they are being treated horribly. but we’re going to build the strongest, most powerful military and —



 — let me just tell you — let me just tell you a little secret. it’s the cheapest thing we can do. we’re never going to have to use it. i don’t think we’re going to have to use it. don’t forget they talk about my tone. i remember when jeb and hillary the same day — mr. trump’s tone is not nice. they’re chopping off christians’ heads in syria and other places and they want me to have a nice tone. i’m supposed to be, oh, isn’t life wonderful, ok?

 look, we’ve got to be tough, we’ve got to be smart, we’ve got to have heart too. we’ve got to have heart, we’ve got to take care of people. we’ve got to fix our health care program. this obamacare is a disaster. you people know.



you people know. obamacare is a total catastrophe. it’s going to be repealed and replaced. it will die in ’17 anyway. i don’t know if you heard what’s happening. but it’s so bad, all the people that they didn’t think were signing up are signing up.

and the other people that are really paying for it are not signing up. and your rates are going up 25 percent, 35 percent, 45 percent. your deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by a tractor, you’re never going to be able to use your deductible. you’re never going to be able to use it. so obamacare is a disaster. we are going to repeal it, we are going to replace it.

there are so many great things we can do on health care. so many good things.



 and it will cost you much less money, and it will be great. i mean, you are signing in programs, things that you will never, ever use, you know that. and you are paying for it. and you will never ever use them. so we will get that straightened out. we are going to straighten a lot of things. we are going to straighten out common core. common core is dead. it’s going to be dead.



 when i look at parents and i see local parents in iowa and new hampshire and south carolina, i went to a school and i saw the parents, they love their children. they want that — they want education. they love — they don’t care about money, they don’t care about anything. they love their children and it’s local.

and they get together and they do wonderful programs. they are smart people as opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats that are getting big, fat checks in washington. i mean, we have such talent in this country and we don’t use it. so, obamacare, dead. common core, gone. we are going to get rid of it. department of education, we are going to get rid of it.



 we are bringing education to a local level. one thing on education. so, in the world, we are ranked number 28. there are third world countries that are ranked better than us in education and many other things. and yet, per pupil, we are number 1, by far — there is nobody close. number two isn’t even close.

so we spend more money for pupil than any country in the world and we are ranked number 28 which is way down at the bottom, essentially. i mean, it’s — can you imagine we are ranked number 28 and we are number 1? and that’s what i do like saying about my campaign, i spent less money than anybody else and i have the best results.

i’m number one by a lot and i spent no money. i mean, my plane cost me some money, but i spent no ads. took a little radio ad in iowa. but i didn’t do that — i took — i think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth. but i spent essentially no money.

and then you have all these other guys spending vast — and they like the way the united states is run. now, why would we put a guy like jeb, like some of the others. it’s not only jeb bush. they spend money. i see rubio on the ads all day long.

you know, the black background. he’s got like a black thing. he should have put something like that behind him, right? right there, the flag.



 no, no. and i like him. i think he is a nice guy. but i see these ads with the backdrop and it is just somber. it’s not — i don’t think it’s good. so, think of it. i spent no money and i’m number one. others spent — they will have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and they are not even in the race. that’s what we need for our country. what? ok. i’ve got 15,000, i don’t know what the hell he means by that but that’s ok. so, but i think he’s a fan. i don’t think he’s a — are you a protester? no. ok. no body likes trump. ok. he’s not a protester. i love you.



 you know, the only time — don’t worry about it. the only time the cameras focus on the crowd is when we have a protester. cause i always have — like, look at this room, packed. i always have the biggest crowds.

and i go home and my wife said were there many people? i watched you on television tonight. i said, i had 20,000 people. she said, they didn’t show it. they have it right on your face. so i have 20,000 people. i have 20,000 in oklahoma, 35,000 in mobile, alabama. nobody knows. because those cameras stay right in your face and i think they can’t move.

you know, i think they might be fixed because modern cameras maybe — except every time there is a guy that stands up protesting, you know, they are on drugs or something, cause some of those guys, it’s like. they don’t even know what the hell they are doing there, all the sudden, the cameras swerve and make perfect shots.

and i like it because then it shows how big the crowds are. so, you know. some time i think i’m going to put in some false protesters. i’ll put in some friendly protesters. it’s the only way i’m going to be able to get the crowd in.

so when we started, i talked about trade. i talked about the border. i talked about a lot of things. and i started on june 16th and — in trump tower, the famous escalator ride. and it takes guts to run for president. i’ll tell you, you know, it’s like, i’ve never did this before.

and, you know, then they tell you on a debate we had the largest debate. we have the largest audience in the history of cable television. then cnn a couple of weeks later had 23 million. fox had 24 million. cnn had 23 million — the largest audience in the history of cnn.

now, they’re there — the cameras are on live right now. i mean, you know. so, the largest audience in the history of (inaudible).

now, the debates used to be, if you go back four years or eight years, you know, whenever the cycles came up, nobody even wanted — they didn’t want the debates. i think they were forced to take them for licensing. nobody wanted the debates. they drew nothing, but now they’re drawing 24 million. now they want to have more debates — "oh, can we have more? can we have more?" can they go three hours?

do you remember when they had the one go three hours? i said, no, i’m not doing three hours. it’s too long. who wants — i could stand up here for 50 hours, but who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of the stuff, right?

"mr. trump, you have 30 seconds. what would you do about isis?" oh, great. and by the way, that question — i hate those questions. you know why? because i want to be unpredictable. i don’t want to tell isis what i’m going to do to knock the hell out of them.



remember, i said very strongly — (inaudible) the oil for what, four years? you’ve been watching. i mean, four years. i’ve been "get the oil, get the oil, get the oil." because who’s going to get the oil? iran is taking over iraq. we made a deal for iran, done by some of the dumbest people on earth, on our side. we gave them everything. they — we don’t even get our prisoners back.

and now iran wants to start negotiating separately for them. can you believe it? i go crazy. we would have gotten them back. all you had to do was say, "we want our prisoners back." they would have said no. i would have said, "i want them back; you don’t understand me. i want them back." they would have said, "no, we won’t do that." i would have said, "bye-bye," and i would have left. then i would have doubled up the sanctions. and i guarantee you...



... i guarantee you that within 24 hours, they would have called back and they’ll say, "you’ve got your prisoners; can we talk?"

and i would have never given them $150 billion. i would have never given them the money. i would have never give — they’re using it — they don’t have to make nuclear. they can buy it. why are they going to make it? then we have the nuclear, where they have self- inspections. how about the area — you know, the big area? they don’t want us there. oh, i wonder why. they don’t want us there. so they self-inspect, ok?

then they have the 24-day inspection, but the self-inspection is the beauty. "we think you’re making nuclear weapons here." "well, let us go check, mr. president, we’ll check."



"no, sir, we’re not making nuclear weapons. nobody — no, we’re not; we would never do a thing like that."

these are people that have deceived us. they’ve lied to us. they’re a terrorist state. but — and i used to say it’s the worst deal that i’ve ever seen negotiated. and by the way, just to finish prisoners. so they’d come back; we get our prisoners. but then when i hear the other day that now this deal is done. it’s all done. and now i hear they want to negotiate to get — and what do they say? they said very strongly, they said, "we are going to want a lot for the prisoners. that’s out — we’re starting off; we’re going to want a lot."

now, we’ve already taken off the sanctions. they’re already rich as hell. what — what’s going on there? that’s why i say, i mean, some people say it’s worst than stupidity. there’s something going on that we don’t know about. i mean, honest. and you almost think — i’m not saying that, and i’m not a conspiracy person. as you said, "we are; we’re saying it."



half the people in this room are saying it. i’m trying to be — you know, i’m just hoping they’re just stupid people, ok?



which they are. or there’s something going on. because it’s — it’s inconceivable. you know, do you ever see where some things are so bad that it can’t be — that nobody can do what they did, right? nobody.

so, iran now wants to negotiate separately for the (inaudible). in other words, that deal is done; now we want to start all over again. and they want a lot. "we want a lot." and i just — i want to just shoot the television, you know? because they would have had it just by saying.

and, you know, when they asked kerry and obama, the deal was made. everybody knows it’s a horrible deal. it’s going to need to — it’s going to lead to tremendous nuclear proliferation, and they’re so rich now. you know, they became — $150 billion — they became so rich. and many other things that you don’t even know about. most people don’t even know what the agreement says.

 but i’ll tell you what, when you look at what we’re doing, we’re not going to have — if we keep going like this, folks, we’re not going to have a country left. we’re not going to have a country. we’re not going to have a country.

and we’re like a dumping ground for the world. we’re a dumping ground. they want to take these migrants — the migrants, you know, and i feel terrible about the migration, caused by hillary clinton and barack obama. they’re the ones that caused it. they go into libya. they knocked the hell out of gadhafi. ok, so gadhafi — they backed rebels who end up killing the ambassador and the other young people.

you know the ambassador was riding in a jeep, one of our jeeps, of course, a military jeep, holding the libyan flag and you know, freedom, freedom, freedom. and then gets killed by the same people. so, we backed people that turned out to be far worse than gadhafi.

look at what we did in iraq. look at what we did in iraq. i mean, what the hell did we get? we spent $2 trillion, and that was as a year and a half ago. i keep saying two or three, it’s a lot more than that. we spent $2 trillion, we have thousands of deaths, and i’m not even talking other side.

you are talking about hundreds of thousands, maybe millions. you have thousands of deaths. we have wounded warriors, who i love, all of. these guys are the toughest — these are the greatest people.



 you know, these are the greatest people. and then what happens? we leave, and we have a president that announces the date of when we are leaving. so, i said, man, if i’m the enemy, i’m just going to go wait for 18 months right?

he gave a date. we are leaving iraq, we will be gone by such and such a time. i said, i’m just sitting there watching and i’m saying, man, that’s really stupid. because, believe me, the enemy doesn’t want to be killed. you know, you hear so much, oh they want to go with the virgins up to wherever they go, right?

they don’t. they want to live. and they want to take care of their families, always their families. you remember that, because their families know what’s going on ok? you think their wives don’t know what they are planning? you think their kids don’t know exactly what daddy is doing when daddy is going to fly into the world trade center? you think they don’t know? they know exactly what’s going on. remember that. and frankly, i think they have more love for their family’s lives than they do for their own lives, ok. but they still want to live. so here is obama, gives an exact date. he gives an exact date and so they pull back.

and everyone says, oh, we are doing so well. look, we’re doing so well. why should they fight when they know, in 18 months, they can go in and take the place? so what happens? so we have isis taking a lot of oil. i said take the oil. remember when we left, i was opposed to going in because i said you’re going to destabilize the middle east.

because you had iraq and you had iran. and i said, they fight, they’re always fighting for decades and decades, for generations. they fight, that’s what they do. they fight. how we ever got involved in this mess is hard to believe. they fight and they were equal militarily. they go this way, 10 feet. they go this way, 10 feet. then they rest a couple of years, then they start fighting again.

then saddam hussein throws a little gas. everyone goes crazy. oh, it’s because (ph) of gas. they go back and forth. it’s the same. and they were stabilized. and i said, if you go after one or the other, in this case iraq, you’re going to destabilize the middle east. that’s what going to happen. you’re going to destabilize the middle east. and that’s exactly what happened. we totally destabilized the middle east.

we have now migrations ,largely because of what’s happened afterwards. you know iraq was horrible. it was stupid to go in and we should have never gone in. but we shouldn’t have gotten out the way we went out. and we shouldn’t have given dates. i mean, i would have probably said we are going to stay forever. and they would have said, oh, man.

and then keep going, keep going and eventually they would get tired and say, this guy is crazy. i mean, he’s never going to leave and you’ll make a deal. but when you announce you are leaving in 18 months or whatever the hell he said, they just pull back. and then as soon as we left, they come in ok?

so they have the oil. you know who the biggest benefactor of the oil is right? china. always china. i love china. i love mexico. their leaders are too smart for us. we have no border. we will build a wall. mexico will pay for the wall by the way.



 we’re building a wall, we are going to have a border. and people are going to come into our country, but they are going to come in through a legal process. they’re not coming in the way they’re coming in now, just walking in like nothing.

they are going to come in, but they are going to come through a legal process. so, with iraq, so we give them the date and they take over. we didn’t take the year. so for four years, i have been talking about it. then because of paris, all of sudden they start bombing the oil.

but i didn’t want to just bomb the oil. i wanted to take oil. they’re bombing. you know, we are bombing. great. what’s going to happen after that? so we’re bombing. and, you know, we are not really bombing it, because they are still selling it.

 i said, how could they keep selling it? obama does not want to hit them too hard because he is afraid he is going to pollute the atmosphere. no, this is serious. now think of it. he talks about the carbon footprint and yet he will fly a very old air force one, an old boeing 747, with the old engines and you know, spewing stuff.

so, he’s got a problem with the carbon footprint. you can’t use hair spray because hair spray is going to affect the ozone. i’m trying to figure out. let’s see, i’m in my room in new york city and i want to put a little spray so that i can —





— right? right? but i hear where they don’t want me to use hair spray, they want me to use the pump because the other one which i really like better than going bing, bing, bing —



— and then it comes out in big globs, right, and you — it’s stuck in your hair and you say oh my god, i’ve got to take a shower again. my hair’s all screwed up, right?



i want to use hair spray. they say don’t use hair spray, it’s bad for the ozone. so i’m sitting in this concealed apartment, this concealed unit — you know, i really do live in a very nice apartment, right?



but it’s sealed, it’s beautiful. i don’t think anything gets out. and i’m not supposed to be using hair spray. but think of it. so obama’s always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, ok? no, no, think of it. i mean, even if you’re a believer in global warming, isis is a big problem, russia’s a problem, china’s a problem. we’ve got a lot of problems. by the way, the maniac in north korea is a problem. he actually has nuclear weapons, right? that’s a problem.

we’ve got a lot of problems. we’ve got a lot of problems. that’s right, we don’t win anymore. he said we want to win. we don’t win anymore. we’re going to win a lot — if i get elected, we’re going to win a lot.



we’re going to win so much — we’re going to win a lot. we’re going to win a lot. we’re going to win so much you’re all going to get sick and tired of winning. you’re going to say oh no, not again. i’m only kidding. you never get tired of winning, right? never.



but think of it. so obama’s talking about all of this with the global warming and the — a lot of it’s a hoax, it’s a hoax. i mean, it’s a money-making industry, ok? it’s a hoax, a lot of it. and look, i want clean air and i want clean water. that’s my global — i want clean, clean crystal water and i want clean air. and we can do that, but we don’t have to destroy our businesses, we don’t have to destroy our —

and by the way, china isn’t abiding by anything. they’re buying all of our coal; we can’t use coal anymore essentially. they’re buying our coal and they’re using it. now when you talk about the planet, it’s so big out there — we’re here, they’re there, it’s like they’re our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe. miss universe, by the way, i made a great deal when i sold — oh did i get rich.



that was a great deal. you know, they broke my choppers on that. they said he talks about illegal immigration, we’re not going to put him on television. first of all, univision is being sued like crazy; you wouldn’t believe it. and nbc, i made a great deal with them, just like an amazing deal, far more than i would have ever gotten — i mean, i made an unbelievable deal — far more than i ever would have gotten if i said i think i’m going to sell it if times were normal, right? isn’t it amazing the way that stuff can work out?

but i love miss universe and i love the universe. but think of it. so china is spewing up all this stuff and we’re holding back. and with china — you know, we signed these agreements where we have to do it now, they have to do it within 30 or 35 years. i don’t think they’re going to be doing it.

it’s like japan. if somebody attacks japan, we have to immediately go and start world war iii, ok? if we get attacked, japan doesn’t have to help us. somehow, that doesn’t sound so fair. does that sound good?


 so south korea — i order televisions, i order thousands of televisions a year. i order televisions because i have a lot of stuff and i like nice brand new — they’re all made in south korea, most — other than sony, and sony, in all fairness, has lost its way. but a lot of them — samsung, all of them. i mean, they’re all pretty much — all of them, right? i think just about. but i order thousands of televisions, they’re all from south korea. so we have 28,000 people on the border separating south korea from this maniac in north korea, we get nothing. what do — we get nothing. they’re making a fortune. it’s an economic behemoth.

a lot of you don’t know we protect germany. germany! mercedes benz, how many people have a mercedes benz? we protect germany. it’s an economic behemoth.

we protect saudi arabia. they were, during the good oil days — now it’s probably half, which is fine. but during the good old — they were making a billion — listen to this — a billion dollars a day, and we protect them. our military — they pay us peanuts, like nothing. and then if we want to buy — we want to move to another location, well, that’s very expensive if we do that. we want — they charge us rent?

i mean, look. we are run by people that are so bad, they’re so out of their league — and i see it, i see it on the stage. you know, they’re — a lot of them are nice people. you know, a lot of people think i don’t like these people. i do like them. but they don’t have business sense, they don’t have business ability, they don’t have common sense. they’re politicians, they’re all talk, they’re no action.

when i say...



... folks, when i say, "we’re going to build a wall." most of them say, "you can’t build a wall — build a wall." in china 2,000 years ago, they built the great wall of china, which is bigger than any wall we’re thinking about, ok? the great wall of china goes 18,000 miles. we have 2,000 miles of which we only need 1,000 miles, because you have a lot of natural barriers, right, that are extremely tough to get across. we have 1,000 miles.

so, china has 18,000 or 13,000 miles, and we have 1,000 miles. we have modern cranes. we have caterpillar tractors — i want to use caterpillar; i don’t want to use komatsu.



made in america.



even my hats, they’re made in america. it wasn’t easy to find a guy that could do those hats. you know what i’m talking about. i see so many knock-offs of my hat, right? "make america great again." i see these things that are out of plastic. they’re out of all sorts of crap. mine are made in america. and honestly, they do a great job, but they don’t produce as many as i’d like because, frankly, there’s a big — i mean, it’s amazing. those hats are amazing. but i wanted to have it made. and you know why i wanted it — i wanted it, anyway, but i also knew that as soon as the hats came out, and other things — we have a website — as soon as the hats came out, i knew the press would be calling. and it’s true. first hour when the hats were announced, i get a call from the new york times. "mr. trump, where are those hats made?" i said, "america."



i knew it. i knew it. because as you know, if i would have said china, i would have been in big, big trouble. but they’re being knocked off all over the world. i mean, i see hats — they’re like helmets. i see them all. but what are you going to do?

but here’s the story. we’ve got to build a wall. so when i talk and when i’m up on the stage with these guys, these people — wonderful people — and a very nice woman, carly. she’s a nice woman. when i’m up on the stage with them, they think i’m crazy when i say "mexico" — i’m saying, "we’re going to build a wall; it’s going to be a great wall; it’s going to be real wall. see this ceiling? this ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall i’m talking about."

i’m talking about a van to get up there. they’re not coming down because it’s too dangerous.



all right? did you ever see what they do now? we have these little walls. they build ramps. they build a ramp. i say, "wouldn’t it be cheaper just to knock the wall down and just..." and then they drive over it with jeeps loaded up with drugs. do you see this? they build ramps. there was a picture in time magazine. it’s a ramp — a little ramp that goes over the wall. so, they have a jeep — over, down, bump, make money. we get the drugs. think of it. we — "build a wall" is right. you’ve got to build a wall.

we get the drugs. they get the cash. no so good, right? we don’t like that deal. our politicians don’t know — they don’t know.

so when i say "mexico’s going to pay for it," these guys on the stage with me, they’re not business people. they don’t understand. mexico makes a fortune off the united states. number one, we give them a lot of money. but in addition to that, they’re taking our businesses. they’re making — you talk about a trade deficit. i’ll tell you what, mexico in a certain way is in a mini-version the new china. mexico is making an absolute fortune — peanuts, compared to the cost of the wall.

let’s say the cost of the wall is $10 billion. that’s a good — i can do great job at $10 billion. i think we’ll have a lot of money left over. somebody else would — and by the way, 20 years ago, they wanted to build a wall. people that are opposed to it now, they wanted to stop and they wanted to build a wall. you know one of the reasons they didn’t build the wall? because of the environmental protection agency, they couldn’t get an environmental impact study approved. can you believe it? because there was a toad or a turtle or a snake or something was in the way.

now, think of it. in china, in the south china sea, there were these low-level land masses that were covered by water, but pretty close to the top. china sends in massive excavators and they’re (inaudible). they’re building military fortresses in the south china sea. and a friend of mine, who is one of the biggest and richest people in china — he’s a great guy. they’re great people. they’re fine. they’re just too smart. i mean, the leaders are too smart for our people.

they won’t be too smart when i put my people there.



when they call up, "we’d like to speak to the donor that is negotiating it." "no, no. the donor now is carl icahn. you’re going to speak to carl icahn." you know carl — great businessman. you have so many people — they call all these business people — call. so, a friend of mine, so i call him, i say, "you’re actually doing that." and then jokingly, i said, "how long did it take to get started? did you have to get an environmental impact study approved in order to excavate?"

he looked at me, goes, "i — i hope you’re kidding when you say that.

they conceived of the idea and they started digging four hours later, ok? there is no, you know, go through 25 years of environmental impact, you are going to hurt the snail. you’re going to hurt this. you are going to — they are doing a big thing.

they excavated — massive, massive — take a look, massive. the biggest excavation. they are ripping the hell out of that ocean. they are ripping it and they are taking their dirt and they are putting it — and they’re building air fields and they’re building forts.

we couldn’t do it because, just like i said for the law. legitimately, they could not get an environmental impact statement. now, that’s probably not the only reason it didn’t happen. i heard their costs were too high. with me, that’s easy.

you know, i’m doing the old post office or watch (ph) you (ph). i’m under budget, i’m ahead of schedule. hey, look at the campaign. the guy’s at $59 million and he’s down at the bottom. i’m nothing and i’m at the top. it’s the same thing.



 i actually said — it’s funny. the other day i got this great review. they said trump is a great speaker. the crowd is spellbound. but he has one problem. and i’m reading, and i want to see. the problem is, he speaks through the applause. in other words, like i say that, you applaud, i start talking you finish your applause. and you know why? because i’m so excited, because we have so much potential. it’s true.

 i don’t want to wait for your freaking applause. we have — i have so many — we have so much potential. there are so many things to do. i don’t really sort of want to wait. i want to do it. and i just noticed, i did it again. you were getting ready to give a big applause, because you like that, and i’m speaking. i killed the applause. but he is right. but except, i’m not a speaker. what i am is a doer. i get things done.



 so, when the people up on the stage with me — and hillary, hillary doesn’t have a clue. by the way, you talk about low energy. she has lower energy than jeb bush, which is hard to believe. she does. and i’ll tell you and i’ve been saying it. and maybe it’s rude, maybe it is not. but it doesn’t matter. we have a much bigger problem. we have to save our country.

so, if i’m rude and if people think i’m rude — i’m actually a nice person. i have a big heart. i want to help people. i want to help the migration. i want to do a safe zone in syria. i don’t want them coming here. we don’t know who these people are. they are undocumented.



 and we should do a safe zone over there. we should have the gulf states — saudi arabia and these states they are not spending. they have got to spend. they have to pay. you know, we are protecting them. we’re doing — they wouldn’t be there for two minutes if we weren’t protecting them. they have to start paying. they are not taking anybody, ok?

how about germany taking millions of migrants. can you believe what she is doing to that country? and she was the person of the year and i wasn’t. everybody said trump was supposed to.

(booing)

hey, what are you going to do. i think she has made a terrible mistake. we will find out. time will tell. they have tremendous crime problems. i think she has made a tremendous mistake. but what i like is in syria, with other people’s money, meaning the gulf states and others and germany and others.

because, look, germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people. they’ll give us the money. we do a massive safe zone. and then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which i will probably be able to get it straightened out, i understand this now.

but once it’s straightened out, they could go home to their country, you know, to their area. it is interesting, i have thousands of people that work for me. thousands. and i have people that come from far — they are all here legally, don’t worry about it. i use e- verify. but i have people — oh, they go and check. these guys go check.

they went into the old post office checking everybody who walked their dog, are you hear illegally? they said they found one person out of hundreds and hundreds. i don’t believe it. but, you know, it is possible somebody slipped — hey, we do have 11 million people in the country. and it is probably a much higher number than that, ok? it is probably a much higher number.

but we have to do something about it and we are going to. so, i just want to finish by saying this. look, we have a situation that is out of control. our country is a dumping ground for the rest of the world. we are laughed at by the rest of the world.

and when i started this journey, and it is a journey, and i do love you people. you’re amazing people. and by the way, you are so smart. a lot of times, they will say, well mr. trump’s people are blue-collar. i love blue-collar. i’m honored by that.

but they are not blue-collar. we have blue-collar and we have executives and we have young people. they say the audience is old. it’s not older. the audience is young. the other night in iowa, i told that, and i said, we have so many young people and the place erupted. they are all young people. we have an amazing thing happening, it’s just...



 look, that’s their way of marginalizing, not even me, they are marginalizing you. it is disgusting. but when i started this journey and that’s what it is, it’s a journey and it’s a movement that’s taking place. it’s a movement. remember the old days? silent majority? it’s not right. it’s a noisy majority. people are angry. it’s a noisy majority. these aren’t silent people anymore. i go to people — you can’t even hear.

this is an amazing thing that’s happened. i received a call from one of the biggest reporters, who happens to be liberal, but that’s ok. (inaudible) a couple of them, right? but, a guy who’s really respected, recently, and he said, "how does it feel?" i said, "how does what feel?" he said, "what you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the united states." i mean, even cnn said, "number one political story of the year is trump." you know what number two was? isis — isis was two. i’d rather reverse it. let isis be one; let me be two, because i want to knock the hell out of them and make me number one next year.



make me number one next year. but this reporter, who is a great intellect, actually, and a very smart guy, very good guy. he said — he said, "what you’ve done has never been done before in the history of this country." newt gingrich was on a television show the other say, and said, "this is one the great phenomenons (ph) i’ve ever seen in politics; nobody’s ever seen it."

crowds like this? forget it. i mean, it’s only confined to this (inaudible). again, they sent 3,000 people home. can you believe it? more than 3,000. it’s — it’s unbelievable what’s happening. it’s beautiful what’s happening. it’s beautiful what’s happening. but newt gingrich said he’s never seen anything like this.

but he said to me, the reporter, he said, "never been done before." i said, "well, you know, it’s fine, but if i don’t win, it’s just a waste of time." he goes, "no, no, no. what you’ve done is incredible." he said, "even if you don’t win, what you’ve done is incredible; you’ve totally changed the landscape of politics."



no, don’t applaud, don’t applaud, don’t applaud. he said, "you’ve totally changed the landscape of politics; it’s forever going to be different. your campaign — there’s never been anything like it." ok, he was very nice. i said, "you don’t understand. you don’t understand. if i don’t win, i will consider this" — and i mean this — "a total and complete waste of time." i really do.

so — because we’re not going to do anything. it’s wonderful. oh, good, i had nice crowds. they’ll write about me every once in a while; every two years i’ll have a story, "trump ran this rather good campaign." if we don’t win, to me, and honestly you should feel the same thing, if we don’t win, it’s a terrible waste of time, because you’ll have somebody else in there. they won’t be able to do what i do. they’re not going to be able to. and even if you get one of these republicans in, like, i didn’t finish the — so, the wall.

when i say "mexico is going to pay," they all laugh. they all go "heh, heh, heh." they think it’s funny. honestly, these are people — they think it’s funny. they’re laughing. you know, lightly, like "oh ho, that’s so funny; ha, ha, ha." they’re going to pay for the wall, folks. they’re making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with mexico. the wall is peanuts. they’re going to pay for the wall.

but i mention it, now they don’t laugh because they’re starting to agree with me. and then the other day, one of the people said — it was ted cruz, who is a nice guy. but he said, "we’re going to build a wall at the southern border." i said, "look" — and my wife is sitting (inaudible) — where did that come from, right? no, ted’s a good guy.

but he said on one of — i think it was on fox, he was being interviewed. and he said, "we’re going to build a wall at the southern border." he didn’t say mexico was going to pay was going to pay. he hasn’t gone that far yet, but believe me that’s going to happen. see, they’re all trying to catch up with me. because when i did this stuff, it was very out there.

now, i’m the one that everybody wants to sort of aspire to. but what happens is — so ted’s up and he’s talking. and, you know, routinely we’re going to have the border; we’re going to have this and that. and we’re going to build a wall.

my wife is sitting there. she says, "darling, did you hear that? he just said they’re going to build a wall. that’s the first time i’ve — you know, that’s what you say." she hasn’t heard that from any other candidate.

ok. so we’re going to build a wall. mexico is going to pay for it. there are so many things we’re going to do. but when i — when i started the journey, it was amazing. i came down — it took courage. i went down in to the lobby of trump tower, on the escalator with melania. i have never seen — it looked like the academy awards, the press. we have a lot of press here today. they’re all live — look at all those live cameras.



so when i came down — when i came down on the escalator, we came down. and i said, "we’re going to do things." and i mentioned illegal immigration. you wouldn’t even be talking about illegal — it wasn’t even on the radar. nobody was talking about illegal immigration. is that right? now, it’s one of the big subjects.

 and that’s why — and one of the beautiful polls that came out, and i’m so proud of it, cnn just came out with a poll a couple of, i guess a week ago — 36 percent for trump; second is 16; third is 14; then 12. so they’re way down. but on the economy, they give me 55 — 55 percent. that’s with 16 people at the time.



on the budget, i mean, i understand — the budget, the economy, i win — i win it hands down, all right.

but listen to this. on illegal immigration, i’m almost at 50 percent.



and on isis, likewise, almost at 50 percent. so people want to be protected, they want to feel safe. they need strength, they need toughness, they need smarts. i don’t want to be tough — you know, i know a lot of tough guys but they’re not smart, and they’re the — they’re the easiest. you can be tough, you’ve got to be smart.

let’s start smart first. you’ve got to be smart-tough. you’ve got to be tough because the world is trying to take advantage of us. so what happens is this. i came out, i started — i did it, i was, oh, that first couple of weeks with illegal immigration and mexico and all of this stuff. then kate was killed in san francisco and jamiel was killed in los angeles. jamiel shaw, an unbelievable young man, was killed, just shot right through the head by an illegal immigrant. kate was shot by a guy who came in five or six times, shot in the back.

so many great people. and that’s — these are two, so many. and then you have the economy and the jobs that are being lost and people aren’t paying taxes and all of this stuff, right? and all of a sudden, people are coming over, and i say the wall and now they’re starting to say the wall. we have to be progressive in our thinking. when i say progressive, i mean like smart. i’m not talking progressive like a bernie sanders would say, the guy want to tax you. think of it.



think of it. this guy wants to raise your taxes to 90 percent. no, no, think — you’ll have to move out of this — i love this area, by the way. i’ve been here many times. great golfing area, right? we love it.



no more golf if bernie sanders — no more golf. no, no, you won’t have any golf anymore. there won’t be — you won’t have any money left to be — you’ll be paying it in taxes. this guy is a total disaster.

and i’m not saying that — i’ll tell you why. you know, hillary said well, i’d like to run against trump, believe me.

this poor chuck todd, meet the press. his show is dying and he keeps saying do it, do it, but i never liked it. you know, i just — he never treated me fairly. so i do his show, he gets the highest ratings he’s had in years. he went from, like — believe me, i won’t even give you the numbers, they were massive, the numbers, right? i saved his life, and then he goes hillary clinton said that she would most like to run against donald trump. and yes — and they’re looking forward to it. trust me, the last person — she’s already gotten a dose last night, do you agree?


 she had a tough night. she had a tough one. she had a tough night looking at the beauty pageant, ok?



so hillary clinton said — and here’s chuck todd — and he’s a nice guy. i’m not trying to knock him. please don’t be insulted, chuck. but she says she doesn’t like him. but he doesn’t treat me right. so he goes the clinton campaign said they’d most like to run against trump, like i’m some kind of a sap. so i call him and i say chuck, let me explain something. when they say they want to run against me, that means they don’t want to run against me, do you understand that? do you understand it’s reverse psychology.

they say they want to run against me — first of all, i’m winning and tied in the polls now and i haven’t even hit her yet. but look at what happened to all the guys i hit. they’re gonzo, they’re gone or they’re failing badly, ok, and they’ll be gone soon.

but hillary clinton — think of it. i say so chuck, report it like properly. trust me, they don’t want to run against trump. the last thing she wants in her whole life is — this was only — i did this in, like, 15 minutes what happened to them, because the husband wants to come and she wants to accuse me of things and the husband’s one of the great abusers of the world? give me a break. give me a break.



give me a break. so the last person she wants to run against is me.

now here’s the story. look, here’s the story. it’s very simple. so i announced — and i was talking about trade, i was talking about the wall, i was talking about the borders, i was talking about obamacare, i was talking about the 2nd amendment will be saved, by the way. the 2nd amendment.



it will be saved. the 2nd amendment is going to be with us if i’m president. you know, they’re doing everything. they want to get rid of the bullets now, they’re doing everything they can —

think of paris, think of los angeles. think if you had some guns in paris on the good side, right? they had no guns. paris has the toughest guns in the world, folks. and france — i mean, you get caught with a gun, it’s — the only one that has guns are the bad guys. so they go in these various places, they called the guy the mastermind. he’s a moron. i mean, this guy was a moron. i call him the guy with the dirty hat, right? they got him so good. by the way, the french police did a great job and our los angeles police did a phenomenal job. they did a great job.



wouldn’t it be wonderful if, let’s see, this guy right here in front of me, he’s a tough guy. this guy with the hat, with the lousy head of hair, but he’s a strong-looking guy right here. this guy right there, see? and that one. wouldn’t it be nice if they had a gun on their waist? somebody. him, him, him, so that when they — you know what they were doing in paris? get over here, boom. get over here, boom. your turn, get over here, boom. one hundred and thirty people with more to follow because there are people that are so badly injured right now in hospitals. other people are going to die.

same thing over there. these are people that gave a party in honor of their marriage. there’s something going on, folks. it’s wrong. they gave them a party. they worked — they gave them a party. she came in on a fiance permit or some nonsense and she was radicalized, and he was probably radicalized by her or he was already radicalized.

and people knew that they were radicalized and people in the area knew that they had bombs — who the hell doesn’t know? you’re their next door neighbor. and they didn’t want to talk about it. you’ve got to report these people. we’ve got a real problem. you’ve got to report them. no more nonsense.

they didn’t report them, and the reason they didn’t is because they don’t disagree with them so much. ok? believe me. it’s not because they were afraid. you saw the one who wasn’t politically correct to (ph) report them. they didn’t want to report them. i mean, give me a break. so we have to change.

so it started off with me where i was going to talk about trade, i was going to talk about all the things, i was going to talk about the military, building it up. i was going to do all of this, but after paris and california, and there will be others because they have no fear of us, but after paris and california, it has totally changed and my poll numbers went up 10 points.

it’s amazing. they went up 10 points. i said, "what, you think it was the debate?" because i did good in the debate. they said, "no. people view you as a tough cookie that’s not going to take this crap." that’s what it is.



and now i talk about protection. i talk about — trust me. the trade — that’s so easy for me. i’ve got the greatest guys in the world. they’re going to come in, they’re going to do a great job. i’m going to do some myself. i always talk about ford. they’re going to built a plant, $2.5 billion in mexico. that’s not going to happen with me. that stuff is — those deals are no good.

ford’s leaving. they’re closing plants all over michigan to build a plant in — in mexico. how the hell does that help us? ok. who are the people that think this is a good thing for us? and in the meantime, in michigan and other places, we have plants closing all over the place and they’re spending — think about a $2.5 billion — then they’re going to sell cars, trucks and parts into the united states, no tax, no nothing.

i’ll say you don’t have to pay a tax, folks. and you know what? ford will say "if i (inaudible) pay a tax, we’re going to stay in the united states." i mean, it’s very simple.



it’s very simple. how about two weeks ago, nabisco announced a big — chicago. they announced they’re going to leave chicago with one of their big plants and they’re going to move it to mexico. what’s my statement? we’re not eating oreos anymore, right? no more.

but i don’t want this. it’s not going to happen. then they’re make — they’re going to make product and they’re going to sell it into the united states? not going to happen. it’s not going to happen. and by the way, i’m a free trader. i believe — we’ve got to be smart. i mean, we’ve got to get something. we don’t get anything out of anything. we don’t get anything.

we lose on everything. that iran deal was a disaster. by the way, think of the iran deal for one second. i always — and this came to me two weeks ago. i don’t know why i didn’t think of it sooner. very disappointed with myself.



the iran deal is the worst deal i’ve ever seen negotiated, ok? i’m wrong. you know what the worst deal is? iran’s a part of that one too. we gave them iraq. that’s even better. think of it. we gave iran iraq. iran has the biggest — think of it. they’re going to have the richest oil — if you go to iraq, take a look. among the largest oil reserves in the world.

we gave them, by decapitating iraq and then leaving, because frankly, once we did it we should have kept 20,00 troops or something, we give iraq. so not only did they make a great deal in terms of the iran deal that we know having to do with nuclear, we also gave them iraq. we gave them iraq, that they’ve been after for 100 years. we handed it to them.

so now, they have the largest oil reserves among — in the world. that’s even better than the original deal. i mean, whoever is representing iran is doing a hell of a job. ok? if that was a stock, you’ve got to buy some.

so we are not going to have deals like that with me. it’s not going to happen. we’re going to become rich again, we are going to become safe again and we are going to become strong again. and...



and you’re going to remember this moment. this is going to be an important moment for all of us. the one thing i have to say and i have to ask you to do, go out and vote. it’s going to be your turn.



number three. remember, it starts on february 1st with iowa. we go to new hampshire, then we go to the finals (ph), so three weeks. we’ve got four weeks to go, and then we have three weeks after we start. no matter what is going on in your life, you have got to out and vote. because if you don’t, it’s not going to happen.

don’t sit back and say, oh, trump is going to do well. the more we can win by, you know, the more power we have in a sense, because it is like a mandate. but you have got to go out and vote. and i will tell you this. it has been an honor to be here, i love this area, i love the people here. it’s been an honor.



but we will make america great again, i promise. thank you.

 (off-mike) thank you very much, everybody. well, i want to begin by thanking the people of south carolina. this is a special state. thank you. these are special people and we got a little boost last week from a place we all remember -- new hampshire. we can't forget it. special, special. we love it. and they sent us in here with a very good feeling, right?



 very good feeling. so i really want to thank you and my volunteers. all of these people -- volunteers and they travel and they -- and i say, "what are you doing?" and now they're going to texas and they're going all over. some are going to nevada. i'll be going to nevada. we're making a big speech tomorrow in atlanta and then we're going right to nevada.

and i think we're going to do terrific and the sec's (ph) going to be very, very exciting. we expect to do very, very well. very well ...



 i want to just say thank you to my family. it's been not easy for them. they don't see me anymore. i'm making speeches all the time and i have a great. i really have a great family so i just want to thank all of you.

and ivanka -- you know we have a hospital ready just in case. in south carolina we're going to have a baby. there's nothing wrong with that, right? so ...



 could be -- it could be any second. it could even be before i'm finished but it's -- but she insisted on being here. it was so important to ivanka to insist on being here so thank you. really good and jared, vanessa, don.

we have a wonderful lieutenant governor who backed us very early in the process.



 you know henry, right? the lieutenant governor of south carolina. i will take him over the governor anytime because we won. we won ...



 he handle that very nicely. he's tough. he's very tough. tiffany, eric, lara and melania. melania, say something. go ahead, please ...



m. trump: just want to say an amazing place -- south carolina. congratulation to my husband. he was working very hard and he loves you. we love you and we're going ahead to nevada. and we will see what happen (sic). he would be the best president ...



 and representing some very, very wonderful children, ivanka. just say a few words.



i. trump: thank you, south carolina. this is an amazing, amazing night. the momentum since the beginning of this campaign has been unbelievable and that's because my father's message resonants so deeply with so many people. so as our family we're incredibly proud. we're incredibly grateful to each of you so thank you for being here to support us. and i will say this, my father is an incredibly hard worker and he'll be working for each and every one of you. so together we'll make america great again. thank you ...



 thank you very much. thank you very much. so i was watching upstairs and it was really amazing to be watching what i was watching. and some of the pundits and overall fair but not too much. but a number of the pundits said, "well, if a couple of the other candidates dropped out if you add their scores together it's going to equal trump."

but these geniuses -- they're geniuses -- they don't understand that as people drop out i'm going to get a lot of those votes also. you don't just ...



 you don't just add them together. so i think we're going to do very, very well. i think we're going to do very well. i want to also congratulate the other candidates. in particular i have to say ted and marco did a really good job and they got -- they did quite well as i understand. no, come on. just one minute. come on. one second, right? good.

ok. we go back to war tomorrow morning. tomorrow morning we'll be back but i just want to congratulate the other candidates. there's nothing easy about running for president, i can tell you. it's tough, it's nasty, it's mean, it's vicious, it's beautiful.

(laughter)

 when you win it's beautiful and we're going to start -- we are going to start winning for our country. we're going to start winning.



 because our country doesn't win anymore. doesn't win. we don't win with the military, we can't beat isis. we have great military but we can't beat isis. we don't win on trade. you look at what china's doing to us, what japan does to us, what mexico is just killing us at the border -- at the border and with trade. mexico is killing us -- absolutely. we'll do the wall. don't worry. we're going to do the wall.

  we're going to do the wall and by the way, who's going to pay for the wall?



 mexico's going to pay for the wall and it's very easy. the other politicians come down, "you can't get mexico to pay for the wall." i said, "100 percent." we have a $58 billion trade deficit with mexico. the wall is going to cost $10 to $12 billion, ok? believe me, they will pay. one of the officials -- actually, one of the ex-officials from mexico had a news conference.

and he announced that we will not be paying for the wall. who does mr. trump think he is? they came to me -- the press. these people -- look at all those cameras back there.



 the press came to me and they told me that he said that he would not pay for the wall. do you have a comment? i said, "yes. the wall just got 10 feet taller."



 it's true. and i love mexico. i love mexico, i love china, i love many of these countries that rip us off because we have leaders that are incomptent and don't know what they're doing. i love these countries. they're great. i have thousands and thousands of hispanics. we're going to nevada.

i lead -- i lead with the hispanics. i'm leading in every poll with the hispanics. they love me, i love them. the problem is -- the problem is that the leaders of these countries whether it's mexico or japan or viet nam which is just doing a big number now all of a sudden or china in particular -- that's the big one. the greatest abuse of a country that i think i've ever seen financially -- china.

what they've done to us is the greatest single theft in the history of the world. they've taken our jobs, they've taken our money, they've taken everything. we're bringing our jobs back, folks. we're bringing our jobs back. we're going to bring them back ...



 and i know how to do it. we've had so many -- we've had so many incredible endorsements and to me getting the greatest business people to endorse me is very important. carl icahn endorsed me, so many others have endorsed me.

and we're going to put these great business people in charge of trade and when china wants to come and negotiate, they're going to negotiate not with a political hack which is what they have now. they're going to negotiate with the best business minds in the world and we have them in this country.

  so we're going to do a lot of beautiful work. we're going to terminate obamacare. it's going to terminated. it's going to be over ...



 it's going to be repealed and it's going to be replaced. and you're going to have much better health care at a much smaller cost because obamacare -- if you look -- look at the increases in your obamacare. twenty-five, 35, 45, even 55 percent. it's dead. it's not working. we're going to go to a plan that's going to be so much better and so much less expensive.



 so second amendment by the way -- this is a room loves the second amendment. thank you, fellows. this is a room loves and cherishes the second amendment. we are going to protect our second amendment. totally ...



 common core is gone. we are getting rid of common core. we're brining education to a local level. the people in this community -- every time i see them they want education locally. the parents, the teachers. they want to do it -- they don't want bureaucrats in washington telling them how to educate their children.



 we spend as a nation more for education per pupil than any other nation in the world. not even close. more per pupil -- second place doesn't even exist it's so different. and yet out of 30 countries we're ranked number 30. you have china, you have norway, swenden, denmark and then you have number 30, the united states. so we spend the most and we're at the bottom of the heap. it's not going to happen anymore, folks. it's not going to happen anymore.



 we are going to build our military which i thank because a number of the people came down and a number of the pundits in washington i -- we love our military.



 we love our military. and by the way we love our police. our police are terrific. we love our police ...



 they are not being treated properly. we're going to build our military so big, so good, so strong, so powerful that nobody is ever going to mess with us, folks.

  and we're going to buy -- we're going to buy the equipment that our generals, our soldiers, that everybody that's in the know want. we're not buying equipment that sells because they have political pull (ph). because they take campaign and they give campaign contributions.

we are going to get the equipment that they want, not the equipment that they're told to have by senators and congressmen in washington. we're going to have great equipment.



 and the reason i can say that is i'm self-funding my campaign. i'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these ...



 i'm not getting millions of dollars from all of these special interests and lobbyists and donors that once they get it they literally do whatever the politicians want. that's not going to happen. and we're going to take care of our vets. we love our vets and they're being treated terribly. we're taking care of our vets.



 so we're now off to nevada and it's a great state. we have great people. we have great people in our nation. no matter where we go -- i went to mobile, alabama -- 35,000 people. we went to oklahoma recently twice -- 20,000 people, 20,000 people. no matter where we go we fill up the arenas.

over here the other day we had a 9,000 -- we had a 10,000 -- we have people. the only thing that stops the crowds are the walls because we can't get them in. we have to send thousands of people away.

time magazine -- time magazine last year did an incredible cover story. they said "it's a movement." and that's what it is. it's an incredible movement with incredible people. incredible people.



 it's an incredible movement with incredible people. i tell you. and whether we go -- honestly whether we go to dallas or whether we go anywhere you say -- you go to l.a. -- you go anywhere you say. our people are incredible. and our theme -- what's our theme? you know it, right?



 our theme which i love may be the greatest theme of all time, right? and the word again eventually is going to come off. we're going to get rid of the whole theme because what's going to happen -- make america great again, right?

and the last two weeks because i've gotten to see so many -- i guess millions when you add them all up with all of these rooms and all of these speeches. and i've met so many people. but the people are so incredible that i've been saying make america great again and it's going to be greater than ever before. that's the kind of potential we have. greater then every before.

i don’t see how there is any room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the statement i made on june 16th during my presidential announcement speech. here is what i said, and yet this statement is deliberately distorted by the media:

"when mexico (meaning the mexican government) sends its people, they’re not sending their best. they’re not sending you (pointing to the audience). they’re not sending you (pointing again). they’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems to us. they’re bringing drugs.they’re bringing crime. they’re rapists. and some, i assume, are good people! but i speak to border guards and they tell us what we’re getting. and it only makes common sense. they’re sending us not the right people. it’s coming from more than mexico. it’s coming from all over south and latin america, and it’s coming probably from the middle east. but we don’t know. because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don’t know what’s happening. and it’s got to stop and it’s got to stop fast."

what can be simpler or more accurately stated? the mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people into the united states. they are, in many cases, criminals, drug dealers, rapists, etc. this was evident just this week when, as an example, a young woman in san francisco was viciously killed by a 5 time deported mexican with a long criminal record, who was forced back into the united states because they didn’t want him in mexico. this is merely one of thousands of similar incidents throughout the united states. in other words, the worst elements in mexico are being pushed into the united states by the mexican
government. the largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are mexican cartels that arrange to have mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. the border patrol knows this. likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. the united states has become a dumping ground for mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world. on the other hand, many fabulous people come in from mexico and our country is better for it. but these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally. i am proud to say that i know many hard working mexicans—many of them are working for and with me...and, just like our country, my organization is better for it.

the mexican government wants an open border as long as it’s a one way open border into the united states. not only are they killing us at the border, but they are killing us on trade ... and the country of mexico is making billions of dollars in doing so.

i have great respect for mexico and love their people and their peoples’ great spirit. the problem is, however, that their leaders are far smarter, more cunning, and better negotiators than ours. to the citizens of the united states, who i will represent far better than anyone else as president, the mexican government is not our friend...and why should they be when the relationship is totally one sided in their favor on both illegal immigration and trade. i have pointed this out during my speeches and it is something mexico doesn’t want me to say. in actuality, it was only after my significant rise in the polls that univision, previously my friend, went ballistic. i believe that my examples of bad trade deals for the united states was of even more concern to the mexican government than my talk of border security.

i have lost a lot during this presidential run defending the people of the united states. i have always heard that it is very hard for a successful person to run for president. macy’s, nbc, serta and nascar have all taken the weak and very sad position of being politically correct even though they are wrong in terms of what is good for our country. univision, because 70% of their business comes from mexico, in my opinion, is being dictated to by the mexican government. the last thing mexico wants is donald trump as president in that i will make great trade deals for the united states and will have an impenetrable border--only legally approved people will come through easily.

interestingly, univision has just announced they are attempting to go public despite very poor and even negative earnings, which is not a good situation for a successful ipo or high stock price—not to mention that i am currently suing them for breach of contract. remember, univision is the one who began this charade in the first place, and they are owned by one of hillary clinton’s biggest backers. after the speech was made, there were numerous compliments and indeed, many rave "reviews"—there was very little criticism. it wasn’t until a week after my announcement that people started to totally distort these very easy to understand words. if there was something stated incorrectly, it would have been brought up immediately and with great enthusiasm.

the issues i have addressed, and continue to address, are vital steps to make america great again! additionally, i would be the best jobs president that god ever created. let’s get to work!



trump: (off-mike) this was going to be a speech on hillary clinton and all of the bad things and we all know what’s going on, and especially how poor she’d do as president in these very, very troubled times of radical islamic terrorism.
trump: even her former secret service agent, who’s seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be our president. there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and i will deliver that speech very, very soon.
but today, there’s only one thing to discuss, the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders. the attack on the pulse nightclub in orlando, florida, was the worst terror strike on our soil since september 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country’s history.
so many people — it’s just hard to believe, but just so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace. the horror is beyond description. the families of these wonderful people are totally devastated, and they will be forever. likewise, our whole nation and indeed the whole world is devastated.
we express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families. we mourn as one people for our nation’s loss, and pledge our support to any and all who need it. i would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of this attack.
thank you. our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of orlando’s lgbt community. they have been through something that nobody could ever experience. this is a very dark moment in america’s history. a radical islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub, not only because he wanted to kill americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens, because of their sexual orientation.
it’s a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation. it’s an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want, and express their identity. it’s an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country.
we need to respond to this attack on america as one united people, with force, purpose, and determination. but the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and to think and act clearly. we’re not acting clearly, we’re not talking clearly, we’ve got problems.
if we don’t get tough, and if we don’t get smart, and fast, we’re not going to have our country anymore. there will be nothing, absolutely nothing, left. the killer, whose name i will not use, or ever say, was born in afghan, of afghan parents, who immigrated to the united states.
his father published support for the afghan taliban, a regime which murders those who don’t share its radical views, and they murdered plenty. the father even said he was running for president of afghanistan. the bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in america in the first place, was because we allowed his family to come here.
that is a fact, and it’s a fact we need to talk about. we have a dysfunctional immigration system, which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens properly. we have an incompetent administration.
and if i’m elected president, that will not change, i will tell you, that will not change over the next four years. we have an administration that will not change. but if i get in there, it’s going to change, and it’s going to change quickly. we’re going from totally incompetent to just the opposite, believe me.

trump: thank you.
with 50 people dead and perhaps more ultimately and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around issues anymore. we have to address these issues head-on. i called for a ban after san bernardino and was met with great scorn and anger but now many years and i have to say many years but many are saying that i was right to do so. and although the pause is temporary we must find out what is going on. we have to do it.
it will be lifted — this ban — when and as a nation we’re in a position to properly and perfectly screen these people coming into our country. they’re pouring in and we don’t know what we’re doing. the immigration laws of the united states give the president powers to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons. now, any class — it really is determined and to be determined by the president for the interests of the united states. and it’s as he or she deems appropriate. hopefully it’s he in this case.

thank you. i will use this power to protect the american people. when i’m elected i will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there’s a proven history of terrorism against the united states, europe or our allies until we fully understand how to end these threats. after a full ...

thank you.
and by the way we have no choice. after a full and partial and long — really long overdue security assessment we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america.

we cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer. many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions.
 remember this, radical islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti- american.

i refuse to allow america to become a place where gay people, christian people, jewish people are targets of persecution and intimation by radical islamic preachers of hate and violence.

this is not just a national security issue. it’s a quality of life issue. if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans — women and children, gay and straight, jews and christians and all people then we need to tell the truth about radical islam and we need to do it now.

we need to tell the truth also about how radical islam is coming to our shores. and it’s coming ...

with these people, folks, it’s coming. we’re importing radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system and through an intelligence community held back by our president. even our own fbi director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of people we’re letting into america. all of the september 11th hijackists were issued visas. large numbers of somali refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis.
the boston bombers came here through political asylum. the male shooter in san bernardino again whose name i will not mention was the child of immigrants from pakistan and he brought his wife, the other terrorist from saudi arabia through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.

trump: immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly five fold — five fold in just one year. according to pew research, 99 percent of the people in afghanistan support oppressive sharia law. we admit many more, and that’s just the way it is. we admit many more from other countries in the region.
and i’ll tell you what: they share these oppressive views and values. we want to remain a free and open society. then, and if we do, then we have to control our borders. we have to control, and we have to control them now, not later. right now.

thank you.
yet hillary clinton, for months, and despite so many attacks, repeatedly refused to even say the words radical islam until i challenged her yesterday. and, guess what, she will probably say them. she sort of has said them, but let’s see what happens. she really has no choice, but she doesn’t want to.
however, she’s really been forced, and she has been forced to say these words. she supports, and the reason is, she supports so much of what is wrong, and what is wrong with this country, and what’s going wrong with our country and our borders. she has no clue, in my opinion, what radical islam is and she won’t speak honestly about it if she does, in fact, know. she’s in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the entire world — true weakness.
i don’t know if you know this, but just a few weeks before san bernardino, the slaughter, that’s all it was was a slaughter, hillary clinton explained her refusal to say the words "radical islam." here is what she said, exact quote, "muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism." that is hillary clinton.
so, she says the solution is to ban guns. they tried that in france which has among the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, and 130 people were brutally murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood. her plan is to disarm law abiding americans, abolishing the second amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. no good. not going to happen, folks. not going to happen. not going to happen.
thank you.
she wants to take away american’s guns and then admit the very people who want to slaughter us. let them come into the country, we don’t have guns. let them come in, let them have all the fun they want.
i will be meeting with the nra, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror. i will be always defending the second amendment.

thank you. thank you.
the bottom line is that hillary supports policies that bring the threat of radical islam into american and allow it to grow oversees, and it is growing. in fact, hillary clinton’s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our society but our entire way of life. when it comes to radical islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss. it’s deadly — totally deadly.
the obama administration, with the support of hillary clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence gathering and we have, just, no intelligence gathering information. we need this information so badly, and he stopped it. we don’t have the support. we don’t have the support of the law enforcement system because obama is not letting them do their job. they are not being allowed to do their job. and, they can do it well — better than anybody.
we need a new leader. we need a new leader fast.

trump: thank you.
they have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else. i refuse to be politically correct.

i want to do the right thing. i want to straighten things out and i want to make america great again.

the days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon if i’m elected. as president i will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks. they don’t have those tools now.

we need an intelligence gathering system second to none. second to none. that includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials, and with our allies, very importantly. i will have an attorney general, a director of national intelligence and a secretary of defense who’ll know how to fight a war on radical islamic terrorism.

and they will have the support that they need to get the job done right, not like it is right now. it’s not right.

we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat. the senate subcommittee on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states since september 11th. nearly a year ago, the senate subcommittee asked president obama’s department of justice, state and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states. these departments refused to comply. nobody even knows why. they refused to comply.
president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activities of any kind since september 11th. so important. the public has a right to know how these people got here, how they came on to this great land, why are they here?

we have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with or supporting radical groups and beliefs, very simple. we have to control the amount of future immigration into this country and we have to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside america. not complicated.

every – and just think of this. take a look. every single event, even a single individual can be devastating, and all you have to do is take a look at what happened in orlando and what happened in other cases. just a single event. and just one person. can you imagine what they’ll do in large groups, which we’re allowing now to come here.
truly our president doesn’t know what he’s doing. he’s failed us and he’s failed us badly. under his leadership this situation will not get any better, it will only get worse. and i’ve been saying that for a long time. each year the united states permanently admits 100,000 immigrants from the middle east and many more from muslim countries outside of the middle east. our government has been admitting ever- growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our own security.
in fact, clinton’s state department was in charge of admissions and the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas. having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan including a 500 percent increase in syrian refugees coming into our country. tell me, tell me – how stupid is that?
this could be a better, bigger, more horrible version than the legendary trojan horse ever was. altogether, under the clinton plan, you’d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of the children and their children. not only their children, by the way, they’re trying to take over our children and convince them how wonderful isis is and how wonderful islam is and we don’t know what’s happening.
trump: the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to really to screen. we’re not screening people.
so why don’t we have an effective screening system? we don’t. we’re being laughed at all over the world. the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian americans. the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it, her plan will cost hundreds of billions of dollars long term.
wouldn’t this be money better spent rebuilding america for our current population including the many poor people already living here. we have cities, we have inner cities...

we have poverty all over and this is how we’re spending billions of dollars. we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states. we don’t know who they are, they have no documentation and we don’t know what they’re planning and we won’t unless we have proper supervisor and proper leadership in which case they’re out of here. what i want...

what i want is common sense. i want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes american values. that’s a choice i put before the american people. a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit america or hillary clinton’s radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically correct special interests. that’s all it is. we’ve got to get smart and tough and vigilant and we’ve got to do it now because later is too late — going to be too late for our country.
the media talks about home grown terrorism but islamic radicalism and that’s a very, very important term — a term that the president refuses to use and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or whether you don’t like it. yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of poor policies of the past.
but the whole point is that we will be much, much and it will be easier to deal with our current problem if we don’t keep on bringing people who add to the problem. and that’s what they’re doing. we’re letting all of these people — hundreds of thousands of people come in and all they’re doing is adding to this incredible problem we have.
for instance, the controversial mosque attended by the boston bombers had at its founder and as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot. this shooter and amazingly in orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth. why would we admit people who support violent hatred?
hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring islamic extremists to our country and who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views or values.

she can’t have it both ways. she can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress these same communities. how does this kind of immigration make our lives better? how does this kind of immigration make our country better? why does hillary clinton want to bring people in in vast numbers who reject our values? why? explain.
ask yourself who is really the friend of women and the lgbt community, donald trump with actions or hillary clinton with her words?
trump: i will tell you who the better friend is and some day i believe that will be proven out bigly (ph).

and by the way the lgbt community is just — what’s happened to them is just so sad and to be thinking about where their policies are currently with this administration is a disgrace to that community, i will tell you right now.
clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to pour into our country. they enslave women, and they murder gays. i don’t want them in our country.

immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities. all of our communities, every single one of them. americans already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, anybody in the world. four times more. at least, because we don’t even know who’s coming in. and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.
not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven’t budged. in almost 20 years. you wonder why we get the crowds, you wonder why we get this tremendous support, you wonder why i’ve gotten more votes than any republican in any primary in the history of the republican party? take a look at that. take a look at your security, take a look at the wages. for 18 years they’ve been stagnant, they’ve even gone down.
so whether it’s a matter of national security, or financial security, we can’t afford to keep on going like this. cannot afford it. we owe $19 trillion in debt. and no longer have any options. our communities from all backgrounds are ready for some relief. this is not an act of offense against anyone. it’s really an act of defense. i want us all, all of us, to work together. we have to form a partnership, with our muslim communities. we have muslim communities in this country that are great, and we have to form that partnership.
now, the muslim community, so important. they have to work with us. they have to cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad. they know it. and they have to do it, and they have to do it forthwith. i want to fix our schools. i want to fix our bridges. and our jobs market, we’re going to have it rocket again, we’re going to make great trade deals. but i want every american to succeed including muslims.
but the muslims have to work with us. they have to work with us. they know what’s going on. they know that he was bad. they knew the people in san bernardino were bad. but you know what? they didn’t turn them in. and you know what? we had death, and destruction.
hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our citizens. i want to protect our citizens, all of our citizens. the terrorist attack on pulse nightclub demands a full and complete investigation into every single aspect of the assault. in san bernardino, as an example, people who knew what was going on, they knew exactly, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it. they said oh, "we thought so but we didn’t want to use racial profiling." which was probably an excuse given to them by their lawyer, so they don’t get in trouble.
we need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates. we need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status. we have to know, and we have to know fast. we need to know if he traveled anywhere and who he traveled with. we need to know, and we need to make sure, every single last person involved in this plan, including anyone who knew something but didn’t tell us, is brought to justice, so when people know what’s going on and they don’t tell us, and we have an attack, and people die, these people have to have consequences. big consequences.

america must do more — much more — to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientation, as you just saw in orlando.
trump: it also means we must change our foreign policy. the decision to overthrow the regime in libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for isis to expand and grow like nobody has ever seen before.
these actions, along with our disastrous iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region. that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism not nation building. no more nation building. it’s never going to work.
and by the way we’ve spent almost $5 trillion over the years on trying to nation build in the middle east and it has been complete and total disaster. we’re further away now than we were 15 years ago. for instance, the last major nato mission was hillary clinton’s war in libya. that mission helped to unleash isis on a new continent.
i’ve said nato need to change its focus and stop terrorism. we have to focus on terrorism and we have to stop terrorism. since i’ve raised that criticism and it’s ok. i’ve gotten no credit for it but these are minor details — nato has since announced a new initiative — front page of the wall street journal four days ago focused on just that. america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism.

pretty much like we did with communism during the cold war. we tried it president obama’s way, doesn’t work. he gave the world his apology tour. we got isis and many other problems in return. that’s what we got. remember the famous apology tour. we’re sorry for everything.
i’d like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solitarily with the people of orlando who have come under this horrific attack. when i’m president i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside our borders. wherever they come from, wherever they were born, i don’t care. all americans living here and following our laws not other laws will be protected.

thank you. thank you. we’re going to be tough and we’re going to be smart and we’re going to do it right. america will be a tolerant and open society. america will also be a safe society. we will protect our borders at home. we will defeat isis overseas. we have no choice. we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety. we will make america rich again. we will make america safe again. we will make america great again. thank you. thank you very much. thank you very much.

thank you. thank you very much, everybody. appreciate it. thank you.

good evening. thank you very much. i speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of israel. i am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the jewish state.
in late 2001, weeks after the attacks on new york city, and on washington, and frankly the attacks on all of us, attacks that perpetrated... and they were perpetrated by the islamic fundamentalists, mayor rudy giuliani visited israel to show solidarity with terror victims. i sent my plane because i backed the mission for israel 100 percent.
in spring of 2004, at the height of the violence in the gaza strip, i was the grand marshal of the 40th salute to israel parade, the largest single gathering in support of the jewish state. it was a very dangerous time for israel and frankly for anyone supporting israel, many people turned down this honor. i did not. i took the risk and i’m glad i did.
but i didn’t come here tonight to pander to you about israel. that’s what politicians do. all talk, no action, believe me. i came here to speak to you about where i stand on the future of american relations with our strategic ally, our unbreakable friendship, and our cultural brother. the only democracy in the middle east, the state of israel.
my number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran. i have been in business a long time. i know deal-making and let me tell you, this deal is catastrophic, for america, for israel, and for the whole of the middle east.
the problem here is fundamental. we have rewarded the world’s leading state sponsor of terror with $150 billion dollars, and we received absolutely nothing in return.
i’ve studied this issue in great detail. i would say actually, greater by far than anybody else. believe me, and it’s a bad deal. the biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that iran is going to violate it, because already, as you know, it has. the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock. and of course, they’ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them.
the deal doesn’t even require iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability. yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years. but when those restrictions expire, iran will have an industrial size military nuclear capability ready to go, and with zero provision for delay, no matter how bad iran’s behavior is. terrible, terrible situation that we are all placed in, and especially israel.
when i’m president, i will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to iran. first, we will stand up to iran’s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region. iran is a very big problem and will continue to be, but if i’m not elected president, i know how to deal with trouble, and believe me, that’s why i’m going to be elected president folks. and we are leading in every poll, remember that please.
iran is a problem in iraq, a problem in syria, a problem in lebanon, a problem in yemen, and will be a very, very major problem for saudi arabia. literally every day, iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states. hezbollah, lebanon received, and i’ll tell you what, it has received sophisticated anti-ship weapons, anti-aircraft weapons, and gps systems and rockets. like very few people anywhere in the world, and certainly very few countries have.
now they’re in syria trying to establish another front against israel from the syrian side of the golan heights. in gaza, iran is supporting hamas and islamic jihad. and in the west bank they’re openly offering palestinians $7,000 per terror attack and $30,000 for every palestinian terrorist’s home that’s been destroyed. a deplorable, deplorable situation. iran is financing military forces throughout the middle east, and it’s absolutely incredible that we handed them over $150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror.
secondly, we will totally dismantle iran’s global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us. iran has seeded terror groups all over the world. during the last five years, iran has perpetrated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents. they’ve got terror cells everywhere, including in the western hemisphere very close to home. iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach, believe me, believe me.
third, at the very least, we must enforce the terms of the previous deal, to hold iran totally accountable. and we will enforce it like you’ve never seen a contract enforced before folks. believe me.
iran has already since the deal is in place, test-fired ballistic missiles three times. those ballistic missiles with a range of 1,250 miles were designed to intimidate not only israel, which is only 600 miles away, but also intended to frighten europe, and maybe someday hit even the united states. and we’re not going to let that happen. we’re not letting it happen, and we’re not letting it happen to israel, believe me.
do you want to hear something really shocking? as many of the great people in this room know, painted on those missiles in both hebrew and farsi, were the words "israel must be wiped off the face of the earth." you can forget that!
what kind of demented minds write that in hebrew? and here’s, you talk about twisted, here’s another twisted part: testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we made! the deal is silent on test missiles, but those tests do violate united nations security council resolutions. the problem is, no one has done anything about it. we will, we will, i promise we will.
which brings me to my next point. the utter weakness and incompetence of the united nations. the united nations is not a friend of democracy. it’s not a friend to freedom. it’s not a friend even to the united states of america, where as you know, it has its home. and it surely is not a friend to israel.
with president obama in his final year, yay! he may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel, believe me. believe me, and you know it, and you know it better than anybody.
so with the president in his final year, discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between israel and palestine. let me be clear. an agreement imposed by the united nations would be a total and complete disaster. the united states must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto, which i will use as president, 100 percent.
when people ask why, it’s because that’s not how you make a deal. deals are made when parties come together. they come to a table and they negotiate. each side must give up something it values, i mean we have to do something where there’s value in exchange for something that it requires. that’s what a deal is. a deal is really something that when we impose it on israel and palestine, we bring together a group of people that come up with something. that’s not going to happen with the united nations. it will only further, very importantly, it will only further delegitimize israel. it will be a catastrophe and a disaster for israel. it’s not going to happen folks.
and further, it would reward palestinian terrorism, because every day they’re stabbing israelis, and even americans. just last week, american taylor allen force, a west point grad, phenomenol young person who served in iraq and afghanistan, was murdered in the street by a knife-wielding palestinian. you don’t reward behavior like that. you can not do it! there is only one way you treat that kind of behavior. you have to confront it!
so, it’s not up the united nations to go with a solution. it’s really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves. you have no choice. they have to do it themselves, or it will never hold up anyway. the united states can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations, but no one should be telling israel that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don’t even really know what’s happening to israel, to anything in the area. it’s so preposterous. we’re not going to let that happen. when i’m president, believe me, i will veto any attempt by the un to impose its will on the jewish state. it will be vetoed 100 percent.
you see, i know about deal-making. that’s what i do. i wrote ‘the art of the deal’. one of the best-selling, all-time, and i mean seriously, i’m saying ‘one of’, because i’ll be criticized as though i say ‘the’, so i’m going to be very diplomatic. one of... i’ll be criticized. i think it is number one, but why take a chance. one of the best-selling, all-time books about deals and deal making.
to make a great deal, you need two willing participants. we know israel is willing to deal. israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without pre-conditions for years. you had camp david in 2000, where prime minister barak made an incredible offer, maybe even too generous. arafat rejected it. in 2008, prime minister olmert made an equally generous offer. the palestinian authority rejected it also. then john kerry tried to come up with a framework and abbas didn’t even respond, not even to the secretary of state of the united states of america. they didn’t even respond.
when i become president, the days of treating israel like a second-class citizen will end on day one. and when i say something, i mean it. i mean it. i will meet with prime minister netanyahu immediately. i have known him for many years and we’ll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to israel and to the entire region.
meanwhile, every single day, you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate israel and hate the jews. it has to stop. when you live in a society where the firefighters are the hero’s, little kids want to be firefighters. when you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes, little kids want to be athletes and movie stars. in palestinian society, the heroes are those who murder jews. we can’t let this continue. we can’t let this happen any longer.
you cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs. glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace. it is a horrible, horrible way to think. it’s a barrier that can’t be broken. that will end, and it’ll end soon, believe me. in palestinian textbooks and mosques, you’ve got a culture of hatred that has been fermenting there for years, and if we want to achieve peace, they’ve got to go out, and they’ve got to start this educational process. they have to end education of hatred. they have to end it, and now!
there is no moral equivalency. israel does not name public squares after terrorists. israel does not pay its children to stab random palestinians. you see, what president obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies. and you see that happening all the time. that pattern practiced by the president and his administration, including former secretary of state, hillary clinton, who is a total disaster by the way. she and president obama have treated israel very, very badly. but its repeated itself over and over again, and has done nothing to embolden those who hate america. we saw that with releasing the $150 billion dollars to iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community. it didn’t happen.
president obama thinks that applying pressure to israel will force the issue, but it’s precisely the opposite that happened. already, half of the population of palestine has been taken over by the palestinian isis in hamas, and the other half refuses to confront the first half, so it’s a very difficult situation thats never going to get solved, unless you have great leadership right here in the united states. we’ll get it solved, one way or the other. we will get it solved. but when the united states stands with israel, the chances of peace really rise, and rises exponentially. that’s what will happen when donald trump is president of the united states.
we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people, jerusalem. and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between america and our most reliable ally, the state of israel. the palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the united states and israel is absolutely, totally unbreakable. they must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against israel. they must do that. and they must come to the table willing to accept that israel is a jewish state and it will forever exist as a jewish state.
i love the people in this room. i love israel. i love israel. i’ve been with israel so long in terms of, i’ve received some of my greatest honors from israel. my father before me, incredible. my daughter ivanka is about to have a beautiful jewish baby. in fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as i’m concerned.
so i want to thank you very much. this has been a truly great honor. thank you everybody. thank you. thank you very much.
wow. thank you very much. hello. i’d like to begin by thanking the people of montana, south dakota, new mexico, new jersey and california. we had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in, very big numbers.
i’m truly honored by your support. together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is and we’re only getting started and it’s going to be beautiful, remember that.
tonight we close one chapter in history and we begin another. our campaign received more primary votes than any gop campaign in history, no matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes. this is a great feeling. that’s a great feeling.
this is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not obama change, but real change is possible. you’ve given me the honor to lead the republican party to victory this fall. we’re going to do it. we’re going to do it, folks. we’re going to do it.
i understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and i will never, ever let you down – too much work, too many people, blood, sweat and tears. i’m never going to let you down. i will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that’s what it is, is a movement.
now recent polls have shown that i’m beating hillary clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she’s made and she has tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially. to everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, i want to thank you. i want to thank you very, very much.
to those who voted for someone else in either party, i will work hard to earn your support and i will work very hard to earn that support. to all of those bernie sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms. and by the way, the terrible trade deals that bernie was so vehemently against and he’s right on that will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible and that’s what i do. we are going to have fantastic trade deals. we’re going to start making money and bringing in jobs.
now i know some people say i’m too much of a fighter. my preference is always peace, however and i’ve shown that. i’ve shown that for a long time. i built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved, always. my goal is always again to bring people together. but if i’m forced to fight for something i really care about, i will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.
thank you. i’ve fought for my family. i’ve fought for my business. i’ve fought for my employees. and now, i’m going to fight for you, the american people like nobody has ever fought before. and i’m not a politician fighting, i’m me. you’re going to see some real good things happen.
just remember this: i’m going to be your champion. i’m going to be america’s champion because you see this election isn’t about republican or democrat; it’s about who runs this country – the special interests or the people and i mean the american people.
every election year politicians promise change. obama promised change and it didn’t work out too well. and every year they fail to deliver. why would politicians want to change a system that’s totally rigged in order to keep them in power? that’s what they’re doing, folks. why would politicians want to change a system that’s made them and their friends very, very wealthy? i beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support, the only way you could’ve done it – landslides all over the country with every demographic on track to win; 37 primary caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.
after years of disappointment, there is one thing we all have learned – we can’t fix the rigged system by relying on very, and i mean this so, so strongly, on the very people who rigged it, and they rigged it, and do not ever think anything differently. we can’t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.
the clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves. they’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and i mean hundreds of millions of dollars. secretary clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server. something about how she’s getting away with this folks nobody understands.
designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her – not right. i am going to give a major speech on probably monday of next week and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the clintons. i think you’re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting. i wonder if the press will want to attend, who knows.
hillary clinton turned the state department into her private hedge fund – the russians, the saudis, the chinese – all gave money to bill and hillary and got favorable treatment in return. it’s a sad day in america when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.
i didn’t need to do this. it’s not easy, believe me. i didn’t need to do it. but i felt i had to give back to our wonderful country which has been so good to me and to my family. i’ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people’s eyes. i’ve visited communities in new york, new jersey, pennsylvania, connecticut, indiana and ohio whose manufacturing jobs, they literally, these jobs have virtually disappeared, an embarrassment to our country and it’s horrible. i’ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration, moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn’t have been in the country – remember it, folks, remember it.
i visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools. i’ve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges and i’ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours it’s really not to be believed, hard to imagine what’s happened to our country. america is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly, auctioned off to the highest bidder. we’re broke, we’re broke. we owe $19 trillion dollars going quickly to $21 trillion. our infrastructure is a disaster. our schools are failing. crime is rising. people are scared. the last thing we need is hillary clinton in the white house or an extension of the obama disaster.
what a crowd, what a crowd. thank you all very much. we love our country, we love our country. but we can turn this all around. we’re going to do it by putting america first. that commitment is the foundation for change that’s been missing and it’s been missing for a long time. it’s important to understand what america first means. it means on foreign policy we will never enter into any kind conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation. it has to make us safer as a nation. this is the opposite of hillary’s foreign policy which invaded libya, destabilized iraq, unleashed isis and threw syria into chaos and created the mass migration which is wreaking havoc all over the world, and while putting iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the middle east and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks. we have made them that way.
you better hope i’m president. on trade, america first means the american worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition. what’s happening there is absolutely a disgrace. no ppp, you’re right about that and you mean no pp. we are going, and remember this; we are only going to have great trade deals, ok. we are only going to have that. we’re not going to approve, as somebody just said, the transpacific partnership which is a disaster, a disaster, for our country, almost as bad as nafta signed by bill clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places, in particular mexico. if it’s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it. it’s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we’re suffering bigly and it’s getting worse.
on energy policy, america first means opening up america’s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers including our wonderful and hard-working miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this administration.
on economic policy, america first means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the united states, substantially lowering taxes for middle class americans and business; likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level. we will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small business and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.
on immigration policy, america first means protecting the jobs, wages and security of american workers, whether first or tenth generation. no matter who you are, we’re going to protect your job because let me tell you our jobs are being stripped from our country like we’re babies. the beauty of america first is that it brings us all together. every american worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges; it’s got to be that way. now, the people in charge say things can’t change. i’m here today to tell you that we have to change. we have no choice. we have to change.
we’re going to put america back to work. we’re going to make our own products. we’re going to put america back to work. we’re going to rebuild our inner cities which are absolutely a shame and so sad. we’re going to take care of our african american people that have been mistreated for so long. we’re going to make you and your family safe, secure and prosperous, prosperous again. together, we will put the american people first again, first again.
we will make our communities wealthy. we will make our cities safe again. we will make our country strong again. ladies and gentlemen, we will make america great again, remember. thank you. thank you very much everybody.

thank you for joining me today.

this was going to be a speech on hillary clinton and how bad a president, especially in these times of radical islamic terrorism, she would be.

even her former secret service agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.

there will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and i will deliver that speech soon.

but today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.

the attack on the pulse nightclub in orlando, florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since september 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country’s history.

so many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.

the horror is beyond description.

the families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.

we express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.

we mourn, as one people, for our nation’s loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it.

i would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.

[silence]

our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of orlando's lgbt community.

this is a very dark moment in america’s history.

a radical islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.

it is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.

it is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.

it is an attack on the right of every single american to live in peace and safety in their own country.

we need to respond to this attack on america as one united people – with force, purpose and determination.

but the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.

if we don't get tough, and we don't get smart – and fast – we're not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.

the killer, whose name i will not use, or ever say, was born to afghan parents who immigrated to the united states. his father published support for the afghan taliban, a regime which murders those who don’t share its radical views. the father even said he was running for president of that country.

the bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in america in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.

that is a fact, and it's a fact we need to talk about.

we have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.

we have an incompetent administration, and if i am not elected president, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.

with fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.

i called for a ban after san bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying i was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. the ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.

the immigration laws of the united states give the president the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the president deems detrimental to the interests or security of the united states, as he deems appropriate.

i will use this power to protect the american people. when i am elected, i will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the united states, europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.

after a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of america.

we cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.

many of the principles of radical islam are incompatible with western values and institutions.

radical islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-american.

i refuse to allow america to become a place where gay people, christian people, and jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by radical islamic preachers of hate and violence.
it’s not just a national security issue. it is a quality of life issue.

if we want to protect the quality of life for all americans – women and children, gay and straight, jews and christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about radical islam.

we need to tell the truth, also, about how radical islam is coming to our shores.

we are importing radical islamic terrorism into the west through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.

even our own fbi director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into america.

all of the september 11th hijackers were issued visas.

large numbers of somali refugees in minnesota have tried to join isis.

the boston bombers came here through political asylum.

the male shooter in san bernardino – again, whose name i won't mention -- was the child of immigrants from pakistan, and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from saudi arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.

immigration from afghanistan into the united states has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. according to pew research, 99% of people in afghanistan support oppressive sharia law.

we admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.

if we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.

yet, hillary clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words "radical islam," until i challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.

however, hillary clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what radical islam is, and won’t speak honestly about what it is.

she is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.

in fact, just a few weeks before the san bernardino slaughter, hillary clinton explained her refusal to say the words radical islam. here is what she said: "muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism."

hillary clinton says the solution is to ban guns. they tried that in france, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by islamic terrorists in cold blood. her plan is to disarm law-abiding americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. she wants to take away americans’ guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.

i will be meeting with the nra, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a presidential race, to discuss how to ensure americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.

the bottom line is that hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of radical islam into america, and allow it to grow overseas.

in fact, hillary clinton’s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more radical islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.

when it comes to radical islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss – it's deadly.

the obama administration, with the support of hillary clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. they have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.

i refuse to be politically correct.

i will do the right thing--i want to straighten things out and to make america great again.

the days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.

as president i will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.

we need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. that includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials – and with our allies.

i will have an attorney general, a director of national intelligence, and a secretary of defense who will know how to fight the war on radical islamic terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done.

we also must ensure the american people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.

the senate subcommittee on immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the united states since september 11th.

nearly a year ago, the senate subcommittee asked president obama's departments of justice, state and homeland security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the united states.

these departments refused to comply.

president obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.

the public has a right to know how these people got here.

we have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.

we have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside america.

even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in orlando. can you imagine large groups?

truly, our president doesn't know what he is doing. he has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.

each year, the united states permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the middle east, and many more from muslim countries outside the middle east. our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.

in fact, clinton's state department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.

having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in syrian refugees.

this could be a better, bigger version of the legendary trojan horse.

we can't let this happen.

altogether, under the clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the middle east with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.

the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.

the burden is on hillary clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian americans.

the burden is also on hillary clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. her plan will cost americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.

wouldn't this money be better spent on rebuilding america for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?

we have to stop the tremendous flow of syrian refugees into the united states – we don't know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don't know what they're planning.

what i want is common sense. i want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes american values.

that is the choice i put before the american people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit america, or hillary clinton's radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.

we've got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we've got to do it now, because later is too late.

the media talks about "homegrown," terrorism, but islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.

yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. but the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don’t keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.

for instance, the controversial mosque attended by the boston bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.

this shooter in orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on earth. why would we admit people who support violent hatred?

hillary clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn’t share their views.

she can’t have it both ways. she can’t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.

how does this kind of immigration make our life better? how does this kind of immigration make our country better?

why does hillary clinton want to bring people here—in vast numbers—who reject our values?

ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the lgbt community, donald trump with his actions, or hillary clinton with her words? clinton wants to allow radical islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women, and murder gays.

i don’t want them in our country.

immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn’t support our communities – all of our communities.

america has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.

not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven’t budged in many years.

so whether it’s matter of national security, or financial security, we can’t afford to keep on going like this. we owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.

all our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. this is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.

i want us all to work together, including in partnership with our muslim communities. but muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are.

i want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. i want every american to succeed. hillary clinton wants to empty out the treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.

i want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens.

the terrorist attack on the pulse night club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.

in san bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.

we need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.

we need to know if he was affiliated with any radical mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.

we need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.

we need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but didn't tell us – is brought to justice.

if it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .

america must do more – much more – to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.

it also means we must change our foreign policy.

the decision to overthrow the regime in libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for isis to expand and grow.

these actions, along with our disastrous iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our muslim allies in the region.

that is why our new goal must be to defeat islamic terrorism, not nation-building.

for instance, the last major nato mission was hillary clinton's war in libya. that mission helped unleash isis on a new continent.

i've said nato needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. since i've raised that criticism, nato has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.

america must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the cold war.

we've tried it president obama's way. he gave the world his apology tour, we got isis, and many other problems, in return.

i'd like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of orlando who have come under attack.

when i am president, i pledge to protect and defend all americans who live inside of our borders. wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all americans living here and following our laws will be protected.

america will be a tolerant and open society.

america will also be a safe society.

we will protect our borders at home.

we will defeat isis overseas.

we will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.

we will make america rich again.

we will make america safe again.

we will make american great again.

thank you.

...we’re doing really well. iowa’s been amazing. it’s been amazing. we’re doing so well and i love this place and i’m back here all the time and i’m going to be here a lot in january.
you’re going to be so sick of me. you’ll probably say, "we can’t give – the caucus, just forget it. we can’t stand the guy any more."
no, you’re going to like me and we’re going to be back and we’re going to do a great job for you. most importantly, we’re going to get to that office and we’re going to do the right thing. we’re going to do the right thing.
so, a few things. a lot – so much has happened.
you know, when we first came out, we were all talking together. and we were talking border security, which we’re just doing so great with the border security.
we’re going to build a wall. mexico’s going to pay for the wall. we all know that. but we’re going to have security. and the drugs are going to stop and the people that are going to come into the country but they’re going to come into the country they’re going to be legal, they’re coming in legally, and that’s the way. that’s the way.
and it affects iowa so much.
so we were talking about. so we were talking about that. we were talking about repealing obamacare. boom. it’s going to be repealed. it’s going to be replaced.
i don’t know if you’ve been seeing what’s happening but obamacare is a total disaster. it’s dying of its own weight.
and by ’17, meaning he’ll be playing golf and i’ll be working very hard. but ’17 instead you’re not getting the people signed up. there’s been a lot of talk about it and a lot of stories about it.
obamacare’s dead but we’ll terminate it quicker than that.
and we will come up with something that will be so good, so much better.
premiums are going through the roof. deductibles are so high that unless you’re close to death, you’ll never going to get to use. and even then i don’t think you’re going to get to use it really.
so, we’re going to take care of that.
and by the way, we have a lot of good people. we have ethanol. nobody is really – we have the ethanol – where are the ethanol people? right?
i was here a month ago and i met with them all and they do a fantastic job. i toured the plants and they do a fantastic job but it’s so important. and it’s another form of let’s stay away from opec and let’s stay away from that middle east stuff. it’s so important...
actually what i don’t understand because the one guy that’s doing pretty good with me in iowa is ted cruz and he’s a nice guy. i mean, everything i say he agrees with me. no matter what i say.
i was going to do one really wild but he agrees.
but with the ethanol, really, he’s got to come a long way because he’s right now for the oil.
but i understand it. oil pays him a lot of money. he’s got to be for oil, right? the oil companies give him a lot of money.
but i’m with you. i’m with everybody. look, i’m self funding. i have no oil company. i have no special interest. i have no lobbyist that want me and you know, they’re representing countries that are ripping off the country, they’re representing companies that are ripping off our country.
all i do is i’m going to be working for you folks. we’re going to do this thing together. we’re going to make america so great again and maybe better than ever before. so important.
so when we first started, i talked about china how they’re ripping us and japan and mexico.
mexico both at the border and in trade. they’re taking so many of our companies. nabisco’s moving there with their big plant. ford is moving there with a big plant. they took a big plant away from tennessee – a great state – they took it away at the last moment.
i’m not going to let that stuff. we’re going to do what we have to do, okay?
but i talked about that...and i talk about it a lot. the fact is that about 2.5 weeks ago with paris, i’m speaking a little bit differently now.

believe me, i can take care of china in my back pocket. that’s easy for me. that’s what i do.
and we have all the cards. a lot of people don’t know. you know, these politicians they don’t understand we have the cards.
you know, with china, our people pay tax. they pay no tax. it’s not supposed to be that way. they call it a tariff because it sounds better. but we’ll take care of that. we’ll take care of all of that.
what happened is with paris, there’s a different mindset.
and when the polls came out last week, my numbers went way up because people felt more secure with me.
now, maybe it had to do – who knows why? who knows?
but my poll numbers went up. and do you ever notice whenever there’s something that i do that’s proper but controversial, they’d say "oh, now he’s gone. that’s it. that’s the end."
i won’t go over all of the different things because maybe you’ll change your minds.
but they’d say, "that’s it. it’s over."
and then they’d come in, "sir, your poll number went up 9 points this week." i said, "they did?" because i have to do what’s right. i have to do what’s right.
and you know what? if i don’t make it, i don’t make it.
i have a good life. we all hopefully have a good life. i have a great family, nice people, wonderful people. they love me. i think. i hope. i think. but i have a great family and i built a great business.
...there’s such spirit...there’s such spirit no matter where i go. you know, i go to dallas. we have 20,000. 35,000 people in mobile, alabama. 20,000 people in oklahoma. wherever we go in iowa, we have these crowds. you know this is supposed to be...for like a record.
it is big and yet it feels intimate. it feels good...
...so i changed a couple of weeks ago. when i saw paris i changed. and a big, big part of what i’m doing now is safety and security and smartness and smartness.
sort of interesting. you know, the slogan is "make america great again" and i’m adding "make america great again and safe again" because we don’t feel safe anymore.
and the problem we have now that we’ve never had to this extent is the power of weaponry. it’s the power. it’s the tremendous power.
you know, 100 years ago, i would have said "let’s not go." i said "don’t go there" anyway. and i said it strongly "don’t go. you’re going to destabilize the middle east."
but the fact is right now, we’re going to have to do things because we have some really, really sick degenerates.
and the press – look at all those cameras going all live, all – you know, nobody else has cameras like this. they can make a speech 100 times they make a speech, nobody cares. look at this.
and don’t worry, they never pan the crowd. you know, they never; they have me. that’s why i’m walking around. i figured i’ll walk around maybe they’ll get the crowd. they never pan the crowd. i tell them "pan the crowd", they never do.
...i had a crowd 7,000 people last week. more. 7,000 people and in a confined space. they had 3,000 people outside that couldn’t get in. my wife says, "darling, the speech was excellent. did you have many people there?" i said "what?" she said, "well, they never leave your face." they keep it purposely. but i’ll tell you the cameras may be a little screwed up where you can’t move them, right?
but every time there’s a protester "well, i’m protesting" and it can be in the back lefthand corner of the room, the cameras swoop over there. it’s true. it’s true. it’s true.
no, i used to think they couldn’t move. you know, maybe there’s something with the crazy computers.
you know, in the old days everything was better right? the car seats. you’d sit in your car and you want to move forward and back, you press a button. bing, bing. now, you have to open up things, press a computer, takes you 15 minutes.
well, the same thing i figured with cameras. i didn’t think they moved. i figured they were fixed for certain reasons. and then i saw a protester and those cameras were bent in positions like you wouldn’t believe possible.
so, they’re very dishonest people. what can i say? not all of them but most of them.

i’ll tell you, you have one of the most dishonest right here in your backyard. the des moines register is the worst. they are the worst. the worst. no, they’re very dishonest.
you have some reporter named jacobs. she is the worst. she will write – so – it’s such misrepresentation. and so i don’t care. i mean, who cares? so i’m saying it right in their backyard. they’re failing anyway. they probably won’t be in business in two years. i think they’re losing a fortune. i think.
you know, it’s funny. every time the des moines register does a poll, i always do badly.
...i’m only doing this so they don’t sue me but i don’t mind if they do. i hope they sue me because they don’t have enough money to sue me. that’s the good thing.
but i believe and i may be wrong – in fact, i’ll say i’m sure i’m wrong but it’s my opinion that they don’t do it properly because you know they poll like 300 or 400 people. i’ll explain it...you know, if they lose 20 people in the pocket. "oh, trump? oh, forget that one. forget that one."
now, i don’t know that they do that. do you do that, des moines register?
but every time i have a des moines register poll, i do poorly. i also do poorly with the bloomberg polls. i don’t know why.
but we had a great poll come in – cnn last couple of days – where we’re leading i think by 13 points in iowa. in iowa.
and then we have another coming where we’re doing well.
but i think des moines register has somebody says it’s coming out sometime. i’ll just tell you, watch – "trump disappears!"
i think we’re going to do so well. i think we’re actually going to even do better. you know, we’re leading in most of the poll. we’re leading in every poll.
except iowa there was one poll – there was one poll, monmouth – i’d never even heard monmouth. what the hell is monmouth? what is monmouth? explain it. i don’t like monmouth. you know why i don’t like it? because they always treat me badly also.
but i only like polls that treat me well.
but we’re doing so well. nationwide, we’re leading every poll by tremendous. we just had one in georgia – 44%. 44%. think of that. that’s 44% with 15 people. i’d take 44% if we had three people. i don’t think i’d take it if we had two people but i think i’d take if we had three. but 44%.
cbs came out as you know, you probably saw that, new york times two days ago and we’re at 35% to a small number. we’re killing everybody in every poll. just one little outlier here.
...again, i’m sure when des moines comes out it’ll be a negative because i don’t believe that poll.
but we are going to win. and i’ll tell you what. honestly, iowa is so important to me. i could say, "oh, let’s not do" – i am an evangelical. i am a christian. i’m a presbyterian. i’m a presbyterian. i love billy graham.
franklin graham came out with the most beautiful statements. franklin graham. he was so incredible. he came out – i don’t know if you all saw the statements he came out with about trump...he was so incredible. franklin graham was amazing, the son of billy graham, who was, you know, there’s nobody, nobody that i’ve ever seen – billy graham was unbelievable. if anybody’s gone to his crusades, they were incredible.
but so i think we’re going to do – we’re doing really well with the evangelicals...
and by the way and again, i do like ted cruz but not a lot of evangelicals come out of cuba in all fairness. it’s true. not a lot come out. but i like him nevertheless.
i think we’re going to do great and we are doing great with evangelicals. we’re doing great with the tea party, leading with the tea party.
and we’re doing fantastic with all the young and middle. we’re doing great with everybody.
and so it’s very important for me to win iowa.

now, i could put less pressure on myself and i could say, "oh, i don’t care about iowa. i don’t care." but i do care. i do care so much about it. that’s why we’re here all the time.
and then the lies happened. you know, when i was using iowa, they lied so much. i said, "the people of iowa can’t be that stupid or the people of the country can’t – ". i’m trying to make a point, right? so i said, "the people of the country can’t be that stupid." well, they cut the "country" out so it’s referring to iowa.
i love you people. remember that. remember that.
i was talking about something, and i won’t even mention what i’m talking about because the guy i’m talking about and was actually a very good guy.
but i will say this. we want to win iowa so bad. because if i win iowa, i think we’d run the table. i really do. i think we’d run the table. we’d go right through.
because we’re leading big in new hampshire – every poll. big. big in new hampshire. christie got an endorsement from this crazy newspaper up there. it’s the weirdest deal i’ve ever seen.
and you know the paper that was in his state called up and said, "are you sure about that? nobody ever called us." they can’t believe it. and we can get into that but it’s irrelevant.
but we’re leading new hampshire big. we’re leading in south carolina like monstrous numbers. we’re leading...nevada. we’re leading in texas. we’re leading everywhere. we’re leading big in florida.
now, you have rubio – nice guy, by the way. you have rubio and he is a nice guy but you’ve got to vote. when people put you in a position to be a senator, you’ve got to go and vote. you can’t be the number one person that doesn’t vote in the senate. you’ve got to say, "hey, i’m a young guy. i want to go and vote." you should stay there a little longer. he’s a good guy. stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record.
but i don’t know. how’s he doing in iowa? not too good. right? he’s not doing well. how’s rubio doing? not good.
i mean, it seems like a two-person race right now...and it’s an important race to me. so i just want to let you know it’s very important.
so with all of that, if we win iowa, a lot of people say we’d just go through. i think we’ll win virtually every state in the union and it’s over quickly. over quickly.
...what about the republican establishment? the establishment’s got a problem, you know. it’s sort of like the fighters. you know, the great champions. sometimes they’ll go into the hometown of a guy they’re fighting and they’ll say, "you know, we’d never want to get a decision. we go for the knock-out. the knock-out is the knock-out." because you get a lot of bad decisions. i know a lot about the world of sports, believe me, and they go into a hometown to fight and it’s a decision and they say, "uh, we’re in a problem" and they’d lose the fight that they won. the only way they win the fight definitely – knock out.
so, if we win iowa, i think we’re going to win everything after that. so i think it’s going to show how important iowa is.
...i’ll pledge this to iowa. even if i lose, i’ll pledge it, okay? i don’t think i’ve ever said that in my life. if we go and win, iowa’s staying right where it is in the chain. it’s not moving. you know, there’s a big move to move iowa into a much further back position by the establishment. folks, i win it’s not happening, okay? you’re staying right here because it’s great. it’s great.


...you’ve been paying into social security and medicare, by the way. let’s put them in. because medicare does work. with both, you have tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. we’re going to take care of that. okay?
but we’re not going to cut your social security and we’re not cutting your medicare. we’re going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off. we’re going to become a wealthy country again. and we’re going to be able to save your social security.
...i can’t believe this number but i read it over – who is the man that told me the number – over 6 million people – i can’t believe it – are aged 112 and over are getting social security...but i heard it. i read it. a tremendous – like 6 million people are getting social security. they’re dead. meaning somebody else is picking up...
...the press is going to have to check it because what do i know? but can you imagine, we have 6 million – now, we know there’s not 6 million, there may be one. but there’s not 6 million.
anybody in this room 112 or over? because if they are, i want to shake your hand.
but – so 6 million over 112 years old picking up social security and that’s the beginning. so there’s tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse.
what we’re going to do is we’re going to save medicare. we’re going to save social security. we’re not going to raise the age or we’re not going to do all the things that everyone else is talking about doing. they’re all talking about doing it, and you don’t have to. we’re going to bring our jobs back. we’re going to make our economy incredible again.
my tax proposal, which is in, and a great detail in terms of policy and it’s gotten tremendous reviews from a lot of people, a lot of great groups.
but we are going to cut taxes tremendously for the middle class and for businesses because our middle class is being decimated.
and when that happens, you’re going to see an economy that takes off. we’re going to get rid of a lot of that debt, if not all of it. but we’re going to get rid of it – you know, we’re at $19 trillion going t $21 trillion right.
you know, if you go back eight or nine years, trillion wasn’t even a word anybody knew and now it’s like routine.
so we are going to save your social security without cuts. we’re going to bring the economy back. we’re going to make ourselves rich again.
a woman said to me in new hampshire recently, she said, "mr. trump, i’m voting for you. i love you. but it’s very crude when you say you’re going to make our country rich again." i said, "i know it’s crude. it sounds bad. but many things i say are crude. it sounds bad. but we can’t make our country great again unless we make our country rich again. we can’t let everybody in the world rip us off.

...we just did a big interview with cnn just before this. and you know, hillary – was hillary missing today? what happened? she was two hours late. no, did you hear?
now, i may be wrong. if i’m one minute off, they’ll call me because they love hillary. they love her. you know why. i don’t know why. why? i’m trying to figure it. no, i heard she was a couple of hours late. everybody left. you know what happened? she was sleeping. i’m telling you. she couldn’t get out of bed. she was sleeping. she was sleeping. was right.
...


remember, we built china. the money they took out of country, we rebuilt china. you go there, they have bridges all over the – they have bridges like the george washington bridge. maybe i shouldn’t mention that particular bridge. but like bigger like the george washington bridge. only a few people got that one; that’s okay.
but they have bridges going up. we have rebuilt china. they’ve taken our jobs. they’ve taken our base. they’ve taken our manufacturing all over the place. they’ve taken our money. they’ve taken our money. not going to happen anymore folks. not going to happen anymore. not going to happen.
i know the great business people. we have the greatest business people in the world. guys like carl icahn. he calls me, "donald, i want to help. i want to help." the smartest people call. we’re not going to use the special interest guy – a donor.
we use donors to negotiate with china because he gave some guy like, you know, whoever it might be. because again, i’m the only one that’s self-funding my campaign. everybody else isn’t.
these guys – when these guys give money to politicians to a large extent they own those politicians. they will do whatever the hell the special interests and the donors want.
that’s not going to happen with me.
so, social security – we’re saving it. medicare – we’re saving it. we’re going to make our country rich. okay? thank you, sweetheart.

...yeah, it’s called the statute of limitations, right? and you know it’s a six-year year statute. maybe five but it’s probably six. but it’s a six-year statute. yeah, you have to look at it.
look, hillary clinton – you know this story. it’s a crime. she committed a crime.
now, perhaps – perhaps – somebody, you know, we have to have a fair justice department and perhaps...we’ll have some really good attorney general that’s going to say "well, you know".
look, we want to be fair to everybody. okay? including hillary clinton. but she committed a crime in my opinion.
now, she shouldn’t be allowed to run. she’s being protected absolutely. i have little doubt that they’re going to find anything. but they’ve already found it.
i mean, you watch television. you have all these big scholars, these lawyers, "yes, she violated section so and so". just one after another. i mean, actually violated many, many laws, not just like a little one here. many laws.
you mentioned general petraeus. his life was destroyed over 5% of what hillary clinton did. over nothing.
so i think she’s going to be their nominee definitely. the only question is whether or not she’ll be allowed to run. she’s being protected by the democrats. she’s being protected by the president. and that’s why – why do you think she’s going along with these insane policies of his? okay? i mean, she goes along with everything.
i don’t even – honestly in all fairness to her, i don’t think she believes it. but i think she’s afraid he’s going to say, "listen, i don’t like her anymore. go take care of her. i’m going to get somebody else." i’m telling you.
so, the question is statute of limitations. it’s a five year statute of limitations. she’s got a problem. she’s got a problem. in one way, she’s running for her life because i know one thing, if she wins that’s the end of that. right? but if she loses she could have a very serious problem.
...

...well, i said right at the beginning. we’re going to build a wall that’s going to be a real wall. that’s going to be a real wall.
it’s not going to be – you see that ceiling? that ceiling is nothing compared to the wall. and we can build it and we can build it right. and it will be strong and powerful and as beautiful as a wall is going to look. it’s got to be beautiful because someday they’re going to name it the trump wall. i know that. it’s going to happen. going to happen.
and it’s going to work. and walls do work.
you know, they wanted to build a wall here 20 years ago. you know they couldn’t get environmental impact statements. that’s just shows you.
china is building in the south china sea massive military bases. right? why? they’re not supposed to. they have no respect for obama or our country. they’re not supposed to be doing that. and you could get them to stop just by saying "we’re not doing business with you anymore." their whole economy would – you don’t have to go to war. it’s economics. the whole country would collapse in two seconds. believe me. we have such power and we don’t know it.
but they’re building massive – now, they had little islands. they put the biggest escavators, not caterpillars. i think they’re using komatsu from japan...they have these massive escavators, and i said to a friend of mine who’s chinese from china – very rich guy, very successful guy, paid me a fortune for an apartment so i happen to like him, okay? – i said jokingly "how long did it take them to do these massive islands they’re building right out of the sea? boom, those shovels go in, take out everything. how long did it take you to get the environmental impact statements?" he laughed. he said, "what are you kidding me? nothing." they say "we will build there." about two seconds later, you have escavators digging.
so we had a problem with environmental – look, i’ve won many environmental awards. i’m a big believer especially in clean air and clean water. i’m a big believer. just so you know. big. and i’ve gotten so many awards for the environment. so i understand the environment; i’ve won many, many awards.
but when you look at how we’re impinged and hurt. but the wall was stopped because they couldn’t get an environmental impact statement among other things. they couldn’t get an environmental impact statement.
now, there was probably a snail or a turtle or a snake or something. you were ruining the habitat of a rattlesnake. i don’t know. but they actually had people – a lot of people – people that now would be against it but they wanted to build a wall and years ago they couldn’t get it done.
...you know, i said bomb the oil, right? i’ve been saying that for three years. now finally they started – after paris they started bombing the oil. i’ve been saying it for years.
you know one of the reasons we didn’t bomb the oil? obama didn’t want to hurt the environment. now, i heard that and i thought somebody was kidding. i thought a comedian was saying it. it turned out to be true. he didn’t want the flames and everything going into the atmosphere. this is the way we fight today.
i’m telling you, folks, we’re being led by stupid people. we’re being led by stupid people.
i’ve been saying not really bomb – i’ve been saying take the oil. i didn’t want to go into iraq. but once we were there, i said "look, we shouldn’t have been there. but then when we left, we left the wrong way."
first of all, we have a president who told them a date. "we’re going to leave on such and such a date." what was it like 18 months later? so the enemy all of sudden said, "wow", ‘cause don’t believe it. they don’t want to be killed. okay? they don’t want to be killed. so the enemy said "they’re going to leave on a certain date?" so they pulled back, the date comes, and now you see what happened. it’s a disaster and iran is taking over iraq.
so anyway, i couldn’t believe it when they said that. when we said to our 50 soldiers two weeks ago and our president gets up and announces "we are sending 50 soldiers."
okay, first of all, he thinks it’s a good press announcement. it’s not. 50 soldiers – that’s not a lot even though they’re the elite. but those 50 soldiers because of that announcement have a target on their heart. they have a target on their heart.
why does he have to say that for? why can’t he let 50 soldiers go there quietly, stealth, stealth? why can’t he just do that? why can’t he do that?
those 50 soldiers are in grave danger today because of that, and they probably don’t even know that but everybody is looking for them and that’s the way it is.
we have people that don’t know what they’re doing.
we used to have general macarthur – douglas macarthur – general george patton. i mean, these were real people. these were real people.
today, we have generals that go on talk shows...i saw a general the other day on a talk show. he said – and this was serious and he’s a good man. they’re good men. but you’ve got to lead these men. even the generals have to have some power over them. he said, "we are in the worst shape in terms of preparedness that we’ve been in in decades." and this is the time when we have to be in the best shape because the world wants to kill us.
and he said we are in the worst shape we’ve been in many, many decades.
now, number one, he shouldn’t be saying that because you’re telling the enemy that and the enemy feels embolden when they hear that. right? we shouldn’t be saying it. we shouldn’t be saying it.
i mean, even if it’s true, you don’t say it. you get it fixed and you do the opposite.
one thing i’m going to do i’ll tell you, i’m going to build our military so big and so strong and so powerful – so powerful that nobody is going to mess with us. nobody is going to mess with us.
you know in many ways, it’s the cheapest thing you can do. everyone is toying with us right now. it’s the cheapest thing you can do. the absolute cheapest thing you can do.

...i’m a big second amendment person by the way.
...my sons are really great marksmen. they’re big believers. and i’m a member of the nra but i’m not such a good shot. but they’re great shots so it’s one of those things.
but if you think about that question. so you know there’s tremendous pressure to get rid of the guns, get rid of the magazines, no bullets. how about the one where they have three bullets in every magazine? ...so the people will put three bullets in. i don’t think the bad guys are going to say, "well, i don’t want to break the law. i’m going to go kill people today but i’m going to put three bullets in." right?
these people – and you know i have arguments with them all the time and i’m a practical guy. honestly, if i didn’t believe this, i couldn’t say it.
so in france or in california, i have a permission to carry, which is a big thing in new york. it’s very hard to get. i have a license to carry.
but in france or in california or in all these places where we see the shooters, right, if instead of having like in france hundreds of people in that room – paris has the toughest gun laws in the world. france has the toughest gun laws in the world. nobody has guns. except the bad guys.
so they walk in with the worst, the toughest, the best weaponry you could have and they said, "over here – boom. over here – boom." so they killed 128 but many more are dying right now. they’re in terrible shape in the hospitals. they just wipe the place out and they could’ve stayed there for longer. they wiped it out.
then you had those two sleaze bags from california. the married couple. i saw the press – "the young married couple that did the shooting". they’re not a young married couple. they’re the worst. they’re sleaze.
...they say "the young married couple". that’s no young married couple.
so they walk into a place and they killed 14 people and others are going to be dying probably because of a lot of other wounded people.
but if somebody had guns in there – nobody had a gun...how would you have done if you had a gun? would you have been firing back a little bit? they’d been in trouble. right? they would have been in trouble. believe me. that guy.
so, you know, i went to like an ivy league college and i have a lot of friends that are against guns and i argue with them. i talk to them. i said, "okay, we’re in paris. you have all these places and there’s hundreds of people. guys walk in with guns and you have no gun. don’t you think they would’ve been better if they had?" they can’t – they lose the argument but they never change their mind.
so we have to fight for the second amendment. it’s so simple. it’s so simple.
and believe me, believe me, they want to take those guns away and you always know that the bad ones are going to have the guns and they’re going to have them more so than ever before. so we’re going to protect the second amendment if i’m president. that i can tell you.
and by the way, we’re going to be saying merry christmas again. do you ever notice?
...and by the way, merry christmas everybody. merry christmas. and happy holiday.
frankly, i have a lot of friends that aren’t christian. they like christmas. everybody likes christmas. it’s politically incorrect to say merry christmas. but when i’m president, merry christmas, happy holidays, enjoy yourselves, don’t eat too much turkey. right?
okay, so we’re going to say merry christmas again folks. we’re going to bring that spirit back.

...i really do. i like ted cruz a lot. and he’s doing well. i’m doing well. i mean, it’s not a contest between the two of us, just so we understand. we have to make that – but i do like him.
and i would say that we would certainly have things in mind for ted, to be honest with you.
i mean, he’s somebody that i can certainly see that because i like him, he likes me. he actually put out a tweet tonight. he said "donald trump is" – i think he used the word – "terrific". that’s a nice word. i mean, whoever hears that?
i can tell you other candidates are not exactly saying that about me. right?
...

...so the super pacs are horrible and i had many set up for me by people i didn’t know. i mean, i’d see them on television talking about – somebody named one "the art of the deal pac". two young guys. they look good. i mean, i don’t know.
but then i got to be, you know, started going around and i see the corruption with these super pacs, with the stuff towards money. people that put the money in are dealing with the candidates. the whole thing is wrong.
and i see it. i mean, bush has $125 million. think of it. $125 million. by the way, if he had $2 billion it wouldn’t make any difference. okay?
but bush has $125 million. and honestly, he’s a nice person. he is. i don’t want to do that but he’s a very nice person. but it’s $125 million. and you’d say to yourself, "people give $2 million, $5 million, $7 million. you know what’s happening."
but some of the super pacs are running campaigns. they’re actually running the campaign.
another thing and it’s sort of interesting, one of the super pacs i believe has $6 million. of the $6 million – this was reported on the front page of the los angeles times – one of the candidates who’s a nice person so i’m not going to mention the name. you know, when i like people i like them. i’m a very loyal person.
of the $6 million after all of the bloodsuckers took their cuts, the fundraisers – can you believe this? – they had $140,000 left for the campaign. that’s better than being a real estate broker. i’d rather do that than sell houses. $140,000 left. that was in the newspaper. i don’t know. i think i believe it.
but i’ve seen it. i saw it with the romney campaign. guys made tens of millions of dollars raising money for romney. i said what the hell is this? i mean, you give money and they get a cut.
look, our laws are so corrupt. our campaign finance laws are so totally corrupt. it’s so horrible. so horrible.
and i don’t necessarily want to stop people from giving because i think that’s a good thing but you have to get away from these pacs.
what you have to have is people have to know who it is. so you have to open up the process. let people know. if somebody wants to give $1 million, you give $1 million but everybody has to know that so and so gave $1 million because that puts a little pressure on guys like brad who raises hundreds of millions. puts a little pressure.
but the concept of the pac is no good. it’s no good. it’s a very dangerous, terrible thing. so we will change our laws because you really have no choice. it’s so out of control. it’s so terrible.
but the papers that are in this room tonight, they should look at this. there’s so little money left over for the candidates, it’s one of the reasons why i’m so happy i’m doing my own.
we actually sent legal letters to either nine or 11 pacs. the trump pac, the trump pac, the this pac. first of all, i’m sure that out of some of them they stole the money. some guy has no money. he sets up a trump something pac. nothing to do with me. sets it up. all of a sudden he’s got $2 million sitting there. right? people send in money. and that guy has no money. how much of that money do you think he’s going to use to do what he’s supposed to be doing? that’s common sense. so maybe all of it but i doubt it.
so we sent legal notices to every one that we could find. we don’t want their money. we said "don’t do it. we don’t want it. and we want ideally to give the money back to the people that gave it to you."
but the super pac concept is corrupt. it’s terrible and it should be ended. and we’re going to go to new campaign finance laws that are going to be terrific. okay? thank you.

...well, look he’s [referring to cruz] from texas. to the best of my knowledge, there’s a lot of oil in texas. right? so you know, he gets a lot of money from the oil companies and he’s totally against ethanol and everything else you’re talking about.
and i’m not. i’m totally in favor.
and you know, it’s a big industry here. it’s a big industry.
you know, if that industry is upset, iowa’s got problems.
i was amazed. i was here three weeks ago with the group...they were such amazing people...and i learned so much about it. i was in favor of it even before...
...beyond even the fuel capacities, which we want to create as much as we can, tremendous numbers of jobs in iowa. and i said to myself, if ted cruz is against ethanol, how does he win in iowa? because that’s very anti-iowa. i don’t know how he wins in iowa. i don’t know.
no, but i’m totally for it. okay? thank you.

...i was a member of the establishment six months ago. i gave $350,000 to the rga. that’s the republican governors association. i gave tremendous amounts of money away. i was like the fair haired boy.
once i said i’m running, they said "what? you’re not supposed to run."
and then what happened – i ran against all these senators and governors. and everyone said "well, i don’t know." my wife said "if you run, you’re going to win" because she understands that i like people – i love people and people love me. and she said "you will run but you actually have to go and run. you have to announce you’re running because nobody’s going to believe you’re running."
and so i didn’t want to announce because i didn’t want to like announce and things didn’t work out and i’m like some of these guys where they’re zero. many of them zero.
and so finally i said, "look, let’s – we’re going to do it. we have to do it."
just too many things that i watch on television with our president and the decisions that are made – bergdahl – where we get bergdahl and they get five killers. we get this horrible, dirty rotten spy – horrible traitor. we get this horrible, terrible traitor and they get five killers that they’ve wanted for nine years – the worst killers – and they’re all back on the battlefield.
you know, so many decisions. the iran deal. the iran deal. how bad is that? they self-inspect. "okay, good. we’re not building. we promise we’re not building nuclear weapons." "oh, okay. that’s okay."
and we give them $150 billion and we don’t even get our prisoners back. the whole thing is crazy. so i saw this. and i said to my wife, "hey, i don’t know if i’ll do well or not. who the hell knows?"
and it’s a risky thing. and i’ve always heard if you’re a very successful person you can’t run for office, especially for president, and i see it all the time. and the people go after me. i don’t even care at this point. i said, "i have to do it. now, we’re going to have to do it."
and i look at it last time with romney and i didn’t do it and i probably should have because he let us down. i mean, look, he let us down.
that was an election – we had a failed president. four years ago he was a failed president, just as bad as he is now. it’s true. and romney let us down. that last month – it was like he wasn’t even campaigning.
i said, "why aren’t you on jay leno? why aren’t you on david letterman? why aren’t you doing it?" and he just didn’t do it. so he lost the election.
so i backed mccain, he lost. i backed romney, he lost. this time i said i’m doing it myself, okay? we’re going to win. we’re going to win.
but there is an establishment out there. it’s a real establishment. real people. and they’re people that are used to having their little puppets all over the place. and they’re people that are used to giving donations and having control.
and they’re people that, you know, look when they call me i’ll treat them with respect but i’m not going to be doing bad things if it’s bad for the country. i’m not going to let ford build a plant in mexico if i can keep it in michigan.
and i’m not going to let the car companies and nabisco and all these people and all these companies – i’m all for free trade. i think it’s great. i’m for it. but it’s got to be smart trade. i’m not going to let them move to mexico and then sell stuff over the border with no tax, no nothing so we lose our jobs, we lose our factories, they go over here, they make it, we let them come through. how does that help us, folks? i went to the best business school in the world. believe me, it doesn’t help us. okay? trust me.
and we’re not going to make deals like that anymore. we can’t. we owe $19 trillion. we can’t.
so the establishment is not ever probably – look, you know what? in the end, if this country starts humming even the establishment they’ll be saying "okay, it’s a good thing" because they’ll be beneficiaries also.
but we do have a real establishment and they’ve never seen this happen before.
a writer called up and he said recently – i told this story. i mean, one of the top journalists to my way of thinking certainly in the country and beyond. and he said, "mr. trump, how does it feel?" i said, "how does what feel?" "how does it feel? what you’ve done has never, ever been done before?" i said, "what have i done?" "you’ve dominated the summer of trump." now they call it the autumn of trump.
hopefully, they’re going to call it the spring of trump and i want the next autumn of trump.
but i said to the writer, "i don’t know what you’re talking about. i haven’t done anything ‘cause frankly if i don’t win i consider this to be a total waste of time." i’ll be honest with you. as much as i like being with you tonight. because we won’t be able to do anything.
he said, "no, no. you’ve won even if you don’t win. you’ve won already." i said, "no, you’re wrong. if i don’t win, i have wasted my time."
so you know, the point is that the establishment can’t believe it because they’ve never seen it happen before.
...i was on the cover of time magazine four or five weeks ago and time magazine was going to pick the person of the year. everybody – even my enemies – said "trump is going to win." i said, "i won’t win." they said, "why?" "i won’t win. just like i should have gotten the emmy for the apprentice for the first three years. i was nominated. i should have." and i said, "i’ll never win." i told everybody i’ll never win because i’m not hollywood establishment.
and with time magazine, i said – bill o’reilly, who’s a great guy, did an editorial at the end of his show two days ago saying nobody has done more than trump, he should have won.
now, i’m not saying i should have – yeah, i probably should have in all fairness – but he said "nobody’s done more" – you know, taking over – what we’ve done has been amazing – all of us together not just me. it’s all of us. it’s all of us. from dallas and mobile and oklahoma. all of us. because the spirit.
...well, merkel got it. now, merkel, what did she do? she’s destroyed – i mean, she’s in the process of destroying germany with the migration.
we have to help the people with the migration. we have to create a safe zone some place in syria. but i don’t want them coming into this country. i don’t want them because we don’t know who they are. we don’t know who they are. them with their printing press that now do the forged passports. okay? you heard about that. so we don’t know.
the bottom line on that – it’s such an interesting question. you’ll know in about a month or two whether or not the establishment has treated me fairly.
but the only thing i can say is this: if i win iowa, i think it’s over. i said before. because i think if i win iowa, new hampshire is amazing. people are amazing. you would love the people. they would love you. you’d love everybody. the whole country is in love...i call it the noisy majority. it’s no longer a silent majority. it’s the noisy majority.
but if we win like i think we’re going to win because we have such a big league, honestly, it’s not going to matter. they can’t do anything. i don’t care about the establishment. they can’t do anything.
you know, the only way they can do is if i’m a little bit short, if i’m two votes short i have a problem because i’ll have to go into that convention, i’m dealing with all these blood sucker politicians and they’ll make their deals and they’ll have all their money guys around and they’ll be in the backroom making deals.
but if i get the number of delegates, there’s not a thing they can do. and i’ll end up doing fine with the establishment...

...i’m such a believer in education.
you know, i had an uncle who was a professor at mit who was a brilliant guy...in fact, i just retweeted an article about him today. you’ve got to read it. okay? @realdonaldtrump. you have to read it.
when i see somebody like jeb – no i’ll tell you one thing i respect. he didn’t change his views. he knew he was getting killed on this issue and he didn’t change. and i respect that to a certain extent. but it’s so wrong.
common core is a total disaster. we have people – bureaucrats in washington – telling you how your child should be educated in iowa and new hampshire and all of the different places that we go to. it’s ridiculous.
and i go around and i’ve seen the principals. i’ve seen so many students and teachers and professors and principals, and i’ve seen some of the people and the love – even in iowa at a school – i’ve seen some of the love these parents give to those schools. this is real love. these are smart people. and these are people that aren’t working for a paycheck. these are incredible people...
remember this: our educational system is a mess. we spend more money per pupil as a government than any other country in the world and we’re in 28th place. and i mean like double what anybody else pays.
so i want to bring education back to the local areas. you’re going to have parents and you’re going to have unbelievably talented people and they love their kids and they want their kids to be well-educated because it’s so important. and you’re going to be very happy with it. okay? thank you. thank you.

...you people do it. we’re backing you 100%...we are backing you 100%. you’re doing a phenomenal job. there should be more people like you in this country.
you know, the whole grid is a disaster. right? the whole country. the infrastructure of our country is falling apart.
and nobody can build like me. it’s what i do. i build. i build.
i’m building on – as you know – pennsylvania avenue a big tremendous hotel that i got from the government of the united states. can you believe it? during the obama administration a couple of years ago.
but we had the best plan. the gsa is terrific. they’re very good. actually, they’re very talented people.
we’re under-budget and ahead of schedule. that’s what we do.
when you see these things where they’re building a bridge and it’s going to cost, you know, $1 billion and it costs $12 billion. how about when they build a hospital and it costs $3 billion?
and i look at it – i’m very good – i can look at a building and tell you how much it’s going to cost.
i say "$250 million." "no, sir, $3 billion." $3 billion? think somebody got rich on that one?
so we’re going to stop all this stuff. we’re going to make our country so strong and so wonderful. and we all love it anyways. we love it.
but it’s so sad to see what’s happening. it’s so sad. and we’re going to change it around.

...we have such a problem. and the biggest problem i have, you know, it relates to education and the hardest thing you get is when you go around and you’d see students and so many students come out to hear us and they always want to talk about the loans – they have student loans – and they’re going through nice colleges, they’re good students, they work hard, they could be really top in their class and they get out and they say, "mr. trump, we have no jobs. we can’t get jobs."
so they’re borrowed up to the hilt and they can’t get jobs.
we’re going to bring our jobs back from china. we’re going to bring our jobs back from all these places overseas that have stolen our jobs.
we’re going to bring our jobs back from south america. we’re bringing them back from mexico. we’re going to have jobs again. believe me. we’re going to be manufacturers again.
we’re going to start making apple computers in this country. what the hell good does it do to make them in china? i want to make them in this country and we have the ability to do it.
so, we’re going to bring our jobs back. okay?

wow! thank you very much.
hello.
i’d like to begin by thanking the people of montana, south dakota, new mexico, new jersey, and california. we had some big, big days and we have some big numbers coming in. very big numbers.
i’m truly honored by your support.
together, we accomplished what nobody thought was absolutely possible and you know what that is. we’re only getting started and it’s going to be beautiful. remember that.
tonight, we close one chapter in history and we begin another. our campaign received more primary votes than any gop campaign in history. no matter who it is, no matter who they are, we received more votes.
this is a great feeling. that’s a great feeling.
this is not a testament to me but a testament to all of the people who believed real change, not obama change, but real change is possible.
you’ve given me the honor to lead the republican party to victory this fall.
we’re going to do it. we’re going to do it, folks. we’re going to do it.
i understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and i will never, ever let you down. too much work, too many people, blood, sweat, and tears. i’m never going to let you down.
i will make you proud of your party and our movement, and that’s what it is – it’s a movement.
now, recent polls have shown that i’m beating hillary clinton and with all of her many problems and the tremendous mistakes that she’s made and she has made tremendous mistakes, we expect our lead to continue to grow and grow substantially.
to everyone who voted for me throughout this campaign, i want to thank you. i want to thank you very, very much.
to those who voted for someone else in either party, i will work hard to earn your support and i will work very hard to earn that support.
to all of those bernie sanders voters who have been left out in the cold by a rigged system of super delegates, we welcome you with open arms.

and by the way, the terrible trade deals that bernie was so vehemently against – and he’s right on that – will be taken care of far better than anyone ever thought possible. and that’s what i do.
we are going to have fantastic trade deals. we’re going to start making money and bringing in jobs.
now, i know some people say i’m too much of a fighter. my preference is always peace, however. and i’ve shown that. i’ve shown that for a long time.
i’ve built an extraordinary business on relationships and deals that benefit all parties involved – always.
my goal is always again to bring people together. but i’m forced to fight for something i really care about, i will never, ever back down and our country will never, ever back down.
i’ve fought for my family. i’ve fought for my business. i’ve fought for my employees. and now i’m going to fight for you – the american people – like nobody has ever fought before.
and i’m not a politician fighting. i’m me. you’re going to see some real good things happen.
just remember this: i’m going to be your champion. i’m going to be america’s champion.
because, you see, this election isn’t about republican or democrat. it’s about who runs this country – the special interests or the people – and i mean the american people.
every election year politicians promised change. obama promised change and it didn’t work out too well. and every year, they failed to deliver.
why would politicians want to change a system that’s totally rigged in order to keep them in power? that’s what they’re doing, folks.
why would politicians want to change a system that’s made them and their friends very, very wealthy?
i beat a rigged system by winning with overwhelming support – the only way you could have done it – landslides all over the country with every demographic, on track to win 37 primary/caucus victories in a field that began with 17 very talented people.

after years of disappointment, there’s one thing we all have learned – we can’t fix the rigged system by relying on very – and i mean this so, so strongly – on the very people who rigged it. and they rigged it and do not ever think anything differently.
we can’t solve our problems by counting on the politicians who created our problems.
the clintons have turned the politics of personal enrichment into an art form for themselves.
they’ve made hundreds of millions of dollars selling access, selling favors, selling government contracts, and i mean hundreds of millions of dollars.
secretary clinton even did all of the work on a totally illegal private server. something that how she’s getting away with this folks nobody understands. designed to keep her corrupt dealings out of the public record, putting the security of the entire country at risk, and a president in a corrupt system is totally protecting her. not right.
i am going to give a major speech on probably monday of next week, and we’re going to be discussing all of the things that have taken place with the clintons. i think you’re going to find it very informative and very, very interesting.
i wonder if the press would want to attend. who knows?
hillary clinton turned the state department into a private hedge fund. the russians, the saudis, the chinese all gave money to bill and hillary and got favorable treatment in return.
it’s a sad day in america when foreign governments with deep pockets have more influence in our own country than our great citizens.
i didn’t need to do this. it’s not easy. believe me. i didn’t need to do it. but i felt i had to give back to our wonderful country, which has been so good to me and to my family.

i’ve traveled to many of our states and seen the suffering in people’s lives.
i’ve visited communities in new york, new jersey, pennsylvania, connecticut, indiana, and ohio whose manufacturing jobs – they literally these jobs have virtually disappeared. an embarrassment to our country and it’s horrible.
i’ve embraced the victims of illegal immigration – moms and dads who have had to bury their own children because of people that shouldn’t have been in the country. remember it, folks. remember it.
i’ve visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools.
i’ve seen our dilapidated airports, highways, bridges, and i’ve compared them to other countries where we see facilities so far superior to ours. it’s really not to be believed. hard to imagine what’s happened to our country.
america is getting taken apart piece by piece, auctioned off, and just rapidly auctioned off to the highest bidder.
we’re broke. we’re broke. we owe $19 trillion. going quickly to $21 trillion.
our infrastructure is a disaster. our schools are failing. crime is rising. people are scared.
the last thing we need is hillary clinton in the white house or an extension of the obama disaster.
what a crowd. what a crowd. thank you all very much. we love our country. we love our country.
but we can turn this all around. we’re going to do it by putting america first.
that commitment is the foundation for change that’s been missing and it’s been missing for a long time.

it’s important to understand what america first means.
it means on foreign policy, we will never enter into any conflict unless it makes us safer as a nation. it has to make us safer as a nation.
this is the opposite of hillary’s foreign policy, which invaded libya, destabilized iraq, unleashed isis and threw syria into chaos and created the mass migration, which is wrecking havoc all over the world and while putting iran on the path to nuclear weapons and making them a dominant power in the middle east. and they are dominant and we have made them that way, folks, we have made them that way.
better hope i’m president.
on trade, america first means the american worker will have his or her job protected from unfair foreign competition – what’s happening here is absolutely a disgrace.
no ppp [sic]. you’re right about that. so and you mean no pp.
we are going – and remember this – we are only going to have great trade deals. okay? we are only going to have that.
we’re not going to approve as somebody just said the trans-pacific partnership, which is a disaster – a disaster – for our country. almost as bad as nafta signed by bill clinton, which has just stripped our country of our factories and our manufacturing and moved them to other places and in particular mexico.
if it’s not a great deal for our country, we will not sign it. it’s got to be great for our country, for our community, for everybody in here because believe me we are all suffering and we’re suffering big league and it’s getting worse.
on energy policy, america first means opening up america’s great potential to bring wealth and prosperity to our own workers, including our wonderful and hardworking miners who have been absolutely totally mistreated by this administration.
on economic policy, america first means having tax and regulatory policies that keep jobs and wealth in the united states, substantially lowering taxes for middle class americans and businesses. likewise, regulation which is strangling our economy which would be brought down from its present insane level, we will make it very, very good for our companies, for our small businesses, and for people that want to survive and do well in our country.
on immigration policy, america first means protecting the jobs, wages, and security of american workers. whether first or tenth generation, no matter who you are, we’re going to protect your job because let me tell you, our jobs are being stripped from our country like we’re babies.

the beauty of america first is that it brings us all together. every american worker of every background is entitled to the same benefits, protections and rights and privileges. it’s got to be that way.
now, the people in charge say things can’t change. i’m here today to tell you that we have to change. we have no choice. we have to change.
we’re going to put america back to work. we’re going to make our own products. we’re going to put america back to work.
we’re going to rebuild our inner cities, which are absolutely a shame and so sad, going to take care of our african-american people that have been mistreated for so long.
we’re going to make you and your families safe, secure, and prosperous. prosperous again.
together, we will put the american people first again. first again.
we will make our communities wealthy. we will make our cities safe again. we will make our country strong again.
ladies and gentlemen, we will make america great again! remember. thank you!
thank you! thank you very much everybody!

thank you, everybody. thank you very much. this has been a great period of time. it’s been really amazing.
we’ve gotten the nomination. we’re going to have an incredible period in cleveland. we look forward to it.
we’ve started working already on the convention.
and lebron, good luck in the series because we’re going to have the series, which of course the longer it goes the less time we have but that’s okay. and it’s going to be very interesting to see what happens.
but as you know, they’re playing the basketball championships partially in that arena so i think it will be very exciting. it’ll add to the excitement in cleveland and that’s good. that’s what we want because it’s going to be an exciting period of time.
we have – we’ve done some awfully good work. i was just informed...that we’ve got more votes than anybody in the history of the republican primaries and we still have i guess six or seven locations to go, states to go.
and in the history, think of it, in the history of this great party, we’ve gotten substantially more votes than anybody else by millions – by many millions more – than anybody who’s ever run.
so that’s a great. you know, when you think dwight eisenhower and ronald reagan and everybody, we have the most votes by far. so that’s something to me that’s very exciting.
and overall, it’s just been a very exciting process. i think we’re going to do very well.
we have no idea what’s going to happen on the democrat’s side but they’re certainly having difficulty. i don’t like to see people having difficulty. but if anybody has to have it, let it be them.
and i think it’s going to be very interesting.
i’m very proud to say that we’ve gotten the most votes and also if you look at the overall primary the amount of votes cast, that’s also a record. so we’ve broken a lot of records in terms of the voters.
our polling has come out and the polls are doing very well as you know. we’re pretty much even and in some cases ahead of hillary. and i think we’re going to have a very, very successful number of months. and i think it will all culminate in november and we’re going to make america great. okay?
so that’s the way it is...



i’m glad you asked the question because i have to tell you i have raised a tremendous amount of money for the vets – almost $6 million. and more money is going to come in i believe over the next little while too.
but i’ve raised almost $6 million. all of the money has been paid out and i’m going to give it to you in just a second.
in fact, i brought a list just in case that question was asked.
but the money has been paid out.
i have been thanked by so many veterans’ groups throughout the united states.
one gentleman called me up recently crying that out of a blue he got a check for $100,000. i have been thanked by so many groups – great veterans’ groups.
and by the way, outside you have a few people picketing. they’re sent there by hillary clinton and they’re picketing that the money wasn’t sent. the money has all been sent.
i wanted to keep it private. if we could, i wanted to keep it private because i don’t think it’s anybody’s business if i want to send money to the vets.
but i have to say this. i raised close to $6 million. it’ll probably be over that amount when it’s all said and done. but as of this moment, it’s $5.6 million.
when this started, it started with a speech in iowa when i said let’s raise some money for the vets and it went up from $1 million to $2 million to $3 million. and it now ends up to be almost $6 million and again i think we can even do better than that.


but i will say that the press should be ashamed of themselves.
and behalf of the vets, the press should be ashamed of themselves. they are calling me. they are furious because i sent people checks of a lot of money.
we’re going to give you the names right now, which is what you want.
and instead of being like "thank you very much, mr. trump" or "trump did a good job", everyone said, "who got it? who got it? who got it?" and you make me look very bad.
i have never received such bad publicity for doing such a good job.
so i will give the names because that’s what you want. right?
okay. are you ready?
i brought them here. it takes – because you have to vet each company. you know, much of this money was paid out fairly early.
but you have to vet all of these different groups because these are many different groups. you have to go through a process. when you send checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars to people and to companies and to groups that you’ve never heard of – charitable organizations. you have to vet it. you send people out. you do a lot of work.
now, most of the money went out quite a while ago. some of it went out more recently. but all of this has gone out and i’ll give you the names.
are you ready? do you have your pad?
and again, i really think the press – look, the media, you know my opinion of the media. it’s very low. i think the media is frankly made up of people that, in many cases, not in all cases, are not good people. but i think this is an example.
and i just on behalf of all of the folks that have worked hard on this and all of the people that have made contributions, including myself; i gave $1
